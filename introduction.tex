\section{Introduction} 
Zuckerkandel and Pauling were arguably the first to suggest the existence of a ``molecular evolutionary clock'' such that the rate of change at the level of molecular sequence appears to be very similar across diverse lineages \cite{zuckerkandl1965}. A pioneer of the application of the molecular clock was Allan Wilson and one of the first examples of molecular phylogenies challenging palaeontological evidence came from Wilson and Sarich's paper entitled ``A molecular time scale for human evolution'' \cite{WilsonSarich1969}.
