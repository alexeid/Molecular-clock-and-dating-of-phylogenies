@article{Kimura:1989eu,
	Abstract = {The main tenet of the neutral theory is that the great majority of evolutionary changes at the molecular level are caused not by Darwinian selection but by random fixation of selectively neutral (or very nearly neutral) alleles through random sampling drift under continued mutation pressure. The theory also asserts that the majority of protein and DNA polymorphisms are selectively neutral, and that they are maintained in the species by mutational input balanced by random extinction rather than by "balancing selection." The neutral theory is based on simple assumptions. This enabled us to develop mathematical theories (using the diffusion equation method) that can treat these phenomena in quantitative terms and that permit theory to be tested against actual observations. Although the neutral theory has been severely criticized by the neo-Darwinian establishment, supporting evidence has accumulated over the last 20 years. In particular, the recent burst of DNA sequence data helped to strengthen the theory a great deal. I believe that the neutral theory triggered reexamination of the traditional "synthetic theory of evolution." In this paper, I review the present status of the neutral theory, including discussions of such topics as "molecular evolutionary clock," very high evolutionary rates observed in RNA viruses, a deviant coding system found in Mycoplasm together with the concept of mutation-driven neutral evolution, and the origin of life. I also present a worldview based on the conception of what I call "survival of the luckiest."},

	Abstract = {Evolution of viral genes is characterized by enormously high speed compared with that of nuclear genes of eukaryotic organisms. In this paper, the evolutionary rates and patterns of base substitutions are examined for retroviral oncogenes, human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), hepatitis B viruses (HBV), and influenza A viruses. Our results show that the evolutionary process of these viral genes can readily be explained by the neutral theory of molecular evolution. In particular, the neutral theory is supported by our observation that synonymous substitutions always much predominate over nonsynonymous substitutions, even though the substitution rate varies considerably among the viruses. Furthermore, the exact correspondence between the high rates of evolutionary base substitutions and the high rates of production of mutants in RNA viruses fits very nicely to the prediction of the theory. The linear relationship between substitution numbers and time was examined to evaluate the clock-like property of viral evolution. The clock appears to be quite accurate in the influenza A viruses in man.},

@article{Kimura1987,
	Abstract = {From the standpoint of the neutral theory of molecular evolution, it is expected that a universally valid and exact molecular evolutionary clock would exist if, for a given molecule, the mutation rate for neutral alleles per year were exactly equal among all organisms at all times. Any deviation from the equality of neutral mutation rate per year makes the molecular clock less exact. Such deviation may be due to two causes: one is the change of the mutation rate per year (such as due to change of generation span), and the other is the alteration of the selective constraint of each molecule (due to change of internal molecular environment). A statistical method was developed to investigate the equality of evolutionary rates among lineages. This was used to analyze protein data to demonstrate that these two causes are actually at work in molecular evolution. It was emphasized that departures from exact clockwise progression of molecular evolution by no means invalidates the neutral theory. It was pointed out that experimental studies should be done to settle the issue of whether the mutation rate for nucleotide change is more constant per year or per generation among organisms whose generation spans are very different.},

The fundamental equations of the general model, with 12 independent substitution parameters, are used to obtain a formula which corrects the effect of multiple and parallel substitutions on the measure of evolutionary divergence between two homologous sequences. We show that only reversible models, with six independent parameters, allow the calculation of the substitution rates. Simulation experiments on DNA sequence evolution through nucleotide substitution call into question the effectiveness of the general model (and of any other more detailed description); nevertheless, the general model results are slightly superior to any of its particular cases.},

@article{Benner:2014kq,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The construction of statistics for summarizing posterior samples returned by a Bayesian phylogenetic study has so far been hindered by the poor geometric insights available into the space of phylogenetic trees, and ad hoc methods such as the derivation of a consensus tree makeup for the ill-definition of the usual concepts of posterior mean, while bootstrap methods mitigate the absence of a sound concept of variance. Yielding satisfactory results with sufficiently concentrated posterior distributions, such methods fall short of providing a faithful summary of posterior distributions if the data do not offer compelling evidence for a single topology.
RESULTS: Building upon previous work of Billera et al., summary statistics such as sample mean, median and variance are defined as the geometric median, Fr{\'e}chet mean and variance, respectively. Their computation is enabled by recently published works, and embeds an algorithm for computing shortest paths in the space of trees. Studying the phylogeny of a set of plants, where several tree topologies occur in the posterior sample, the posterior mean balances correctly the contributions from the different topologies, where a consensus tree would be biased. Comparisons of the posterior mean, median and consensus trees with the ground truth using simulated data also reveals the benefits of a sound averaging method when reconstructing phylogenetic trees.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We provide two independent implementations of the algorithm for computing Fr{\'e}chet means, geometric medians and variances in the space of phylogenetic trees. TFBayes: https://github.com/pbenner/tfbayes, TrAP: https://github.com/bacak/TrAP.

	Abstract = {Recent implementations of path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) have been shown to outperform the harmonic mean estimator (HME) and a posterior simulation-based analog of Akaike's information criterion through Markov chain Monte Carlo (AICM), in bayesian model selection of demographic and molecular clock models. Almost simultaneously, a bayesian model averaging approach was developed that avoids conditioning on a single model but averages over a set of relaxed clock models. This approach returns estimates of the posterior probability of each clock model through which one can estimate the Bayes factor in favor of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) clock model; however, this Bayes factor estimate may suffer when the posterior probability of the MAP model approaches 1. Here, we compare these two recent developments with the HME, stabilized/smoothed HME (sHME), and AICM, using both synthetic and empirical data. Our comparison shows reassuringly that MAP identification and its Bayes factor provide similar performance to PS and SS and that these approaches considerably outperform HME, sHME, and AICM in selecting the correct underlying clock model. We also illustrate the importance of using proper priors on a large set of empirical data sets.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous paper, we introduced MUSCLE, a new program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences, giving a brief summary of the algorithm and showing MUSCLE to achieve the highest scores reported to date on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. Here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option, MUSCLE-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles.
RESULTS: We compare the speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with CLUSTALW, Progressive POA and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test three variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings), highest speed (MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to CLUSTALW in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length 282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer.
CONCLUSIONS: MUSCLE offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment accuracy compared with currently available programs. MUSCLE is freely available at http://www.drive5.com/muscle.},

	Abstract = {A multiple sequence alignment program, MAFFT, has been developed. The CPU time is drastically reduced as compared with existing methods. MAFFT includes two novel techniques. (i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT-NS-i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

@article{BrownYang2011,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding causes of biological diversity may be greatly enhanced by knowledge of divergence times. Strict and relaxed clock models are used in Bayesian estimation of divergence times. We examined whether: i) strict clock models are generally more appropriate in shallow phylogenies where rate variation is expected to be low, ii) the likelihood ratio test of the clock (LRT) reliably informs which model is appropriate for dating divergence times. Strict and relaxed models were used to analyse sequences simulated under different levels of rate variation. Published shallow phylogenies (Black bass, Primate-sucking lice, Podarcis lizards, Gallotiinae lizards, and Caprinae mammals) were also analysed to determine natural levels of rate variation relative to the performance of the different models.
RESULTS: Strict clock analyses performed well on data simulated under the independent rates model when the standard deviation of log rate on branches, σ, was low (≤ 0.1), but were inappropriate when σ>0.1 (95% of rates fall within 0.0082-0.0121 subs/site/Ma when σ = 0.1, for a mean rate of 0.01). The independent rates relaxed clock model performed well at all levels of rate variation, although posterior intervals on times were significantly wider than for the strict clock. The strict clock is therefore superior when rate variation is low. The performance of a correlated rates relaxed clock model was similar to the strict clock. Increased numbers of independent loci led to slightly narrower posteriors under the relaxed clock while older root ages provided proportionately narrower posteriors. The LRT had low power for σ = 0.01-0.1, but high power for σ = 0.5-2.0. Posterior means of σ2 were useful for assessing rate variation in published datasets. Estimates of natural levels of rate variation ranged from 0.05-3.38 for different partitions. Differences in divergence times between relaxed and strict clock analyses were greater in two datasets with higher σ2 for one or more partitions, supporting the simulation results.
CONCLUSIONS: The strict clock can be superior for trees with shallow roots because of low levels of rate variation between branches. The LRT allows robust assessment of suitability of the clock model as does examination of posteriors on σ2.},

@article{Heath2014fossilized,
	Abstract = {Time-calibrated species phylogenies are critical for addressing a wide range of questions in evolutionary biology, such as those that elucidate historical biogeography or uncover patterns of coevolution and diversification. Because molecular sequence data are not informative on absolute time, external data-most commonly, fossil age estimates-are required to calibrate estimates of species divergence dates. For Bayesian divergence time methods, the common practice for calibration using fossil information involves placing arbitrarily chosen parametric distributions on internal nodes, often disregarding most of the information in the fossil record. We introduce the "fossilized birth-death" (FBD) process-a model for calibrating divergence time estimates in a Bayesian framework, explicitly acknowledging that extant species and fossils are part of the same macroevolutionary process. Under this model, absolute node age estimates are calibrated by a single diversification model and arbitrary calibration densities are not necessary. Moreover, the FBD model allows for inclusion of all available fossils. We performed analyses of simulated data and show that node age estimation under the FBD model results in robust and accurate estimates of species divergence times with realistic measures of statistical uncertainty, overcoming major limitations of standard divergence time estimation methods. We used this model to estimate the speciation times for a dataset composed of all living bears, indicating that the genus Ursus diversified in the Late Miocene to Middle Pliocene.},

	Abstract = {Probabilistic inference of a phylogenetic tree from molecular sequence data is predicated on a substitution model describing the relative rates of change between character states along the tree for each site in the multiple sequence alignment. Commonly, one assumes that the substitution model is homogeneous across sites within large partitions of the alignment, assigns these partitions a priori, and then fixes their underlying substitution model to the best-fitting model from a hierarchy of named models. Here, we introduce an automatic model selection and model averaging approach within a Bayesian framework that simultaneously estimates the number of partitions, the assignment of sites to partitions, the substitution model for each partition, and the uncertainty in these selections. This new approach is implemented as an add-on to the BEAST 2 software platform. We find that this approach dramatically improves the fit of the nucleotide substitution model compared with existing approaches, and we show, using a number of example data sets, that as many as nine partitions are required to explain the heterogeneity in nucleotide substitution process across sites in a single gene analysis. In some instances, this improved modeling of the substitution process can have a measurable effect on downstream inference, including the estimated phylogeny, relative divergence times, and effective population size histories.},

	Abstract = {The birth-death process is widely used in phylogenetics to model speciation and extinction. Recent studies have shown that the inferred rates are sensitive to assumptions about the sampling probability of lineages. Here, we examine the effect of the method used to sample lineages. Whereas previous studies have assumed random sampling (RS), we consider two extreme cases of biased sampling: "diversified sampling" (DS), where tips are selected to maximize diversity and "cluster sampling (CS)," where sample diversity is minimized. DS appears to be standard practice, for example, in analyses of higher taxa, whereas CS may occur under special circumstances, for example, in studies of geographically defined floras or faunas. Using both simulations and analyses of empirical data, we show that inferred rates may be heavily biased if the sampling strategy is not modeled correctly. In particular, when a diversified sample is treated as if it were a random or complete sample, the extinction rate is severely underestimated, often close to 0. Such dramatic errors may lead to serious consequences, for example, if estimated rates are used in assessing the vulnerability of threatened species to extinction. Using Bayesian model testing across 18 empirical data sets, we show that DS is commonly a better fit to the data than complete, random, or cluster sampling (CS). Inappropriate modeling of the sampling method may at least partly explain anomalous results that have previously been attributed to variation over time in birth and death rates.},

	Abstract = {We describe a statistical framework for reconstructing the sequence of transmission events between observed cases of an endemic infectious disease using genetic, temporal and spatial information. Previous approaches to reconstructing transmission trees have assumed all infections in the study area originated from a single introduction and that a large fraction of cases were observed. There are as yet no approaches appropriate for endemic situations in which a disease is already well established in a host population and in which there may be multiple origins of infection, or that can enumerate unobserved infections missing from the sample. Our proposed framework addresses these shortcomings, enabling reconstruction of partially observed transmission trees and estimating the number of cases missing from the sample. Analyses of simulated datasets show the method to be accurate in identifying direct transmissions, while introductions and transmissions via one or more unsampled intermediate cases could be identified at high to moderate levels of case detection. When applied to partial genome sequences of rabies virus sampled from an endemic region of South Africa, our method reveals several distinct transmission cycles with little contact between them, and direct transmission over long distances suggesting significant anthropogenic influence in the movement of infected dogs.},

We used whole-genome sequencing to compare the accumulation of mutations in Mtb isolated from cynomolgus macaques with active, latent or reactivated disease. We sequenced 33 Mtb isolates from nine macaques with an average genome coverage of 93% and an average read depth of 117×. Based on the distribution of SNPs observed, we calculated the mutation rates for these disease states. We found a similar mutation rate during latency as during active disease or in a logarithmically growing culture over the same period of time. The pattern of polymorphisms suggests that the mutational burden in vivo is because of oxidative DNA damage. We show that Mtb continues to acquire mutations during disease latency, which may explain why isoniazid monotherapy for latent tuberculosis is a risk factor for the emergence of isoniazid resistance.},

	Abstract = {Phylogenies are usually dated by calibrating interior nodes against the fossil record. This relies on indirect methods that, in the worst case, misrepresent the fossil information. Here, we contrast such node dating with an approach that includes fossils along with the extant taxa in a Bayesian total-evidence analysis. As a test case, we focus on the early radiation of the Hymenoptera, mostly documented by poorly preserved impression fossils that are difficult to place phylogenetically. Specifically, we compare node dating using nine calibration points derived from the fossil record with total-evidence dating based on 343 morphological characters scored for 45 fossil (4--20 complete) and 68 extant taxa. In both cases we use molecular data from seven markers (∼5 kb) for the extant taxa. Because it is difficult to model speciation, extinction, sampling, and fossil preservation realistically, we develop a simple uniform prior for clock trees with fossils, and we use relaxed clock models to accommodate rate variation across the tree. Despite considerable uncertainty in the placement of most fossils, we find that they contribute significantly to the estimation of divergence times in the total-evidence analysis. In particular, the posterior distributions on divergence times are less sensitive to prior assumptions and tend to be more precise than in node dating. The total-evidence analysis also shows that four of the seven Hymenoptera calibration points used in node dating are likely to be based on erroneous or doubtful assumptions about the fossil placement. With respect to the early radiation of Hymenoptera, our results suggest that the crown group dates back to the Carboniferous, ∼309 Ma (95% interval: 291--347 Ma), and diversified into major extant lineages much earlier than previously thought, well before the Triassic.

	Abstract = {Detailed knowledge about the rate and mode of the genetic variation is vital for understanding how HIV-1 induces disease and develops resistance as well as for studies on the molecular epidemiology and origin of the virus. To unveil the molecular clock of HIV-1 we analyzed a unique set of viruses from a known transmission history with separation times between samples of up to 25 years. The env V3 and p17gag regions of the genome were sequenced, and genetic distances were estimated by using the true tree and a nucleotide substitution model based on a general reversible Markov process with a gamma distribution to account for differences in substitution rates among sites. Linear regression analysis showed that separation times were significantly correlated with synonymous as well as nonsynonymous nucleotide distances in both V3 and p17, giving strong support for the existence of a molecular clock. The estimated rate of nucleotide substitution was 6.7 +/- 2.1 x 10(-3) substitutions/site per year in V3 and 2.7 +/- 0.5 x 10(-3) in p17. Importantly, the regression analyses showed that there was a significant genetic distance at zero divergence times. This pretransmission interval exists because the ramifications in the phylogenetic trees do not correspond to time of transmission, but rather to the coalescence time of the most recent common ancestor of the viruses carried by the transmitter and the recipient. Simulation experiments showed that neither the V3 nor the p17 clocks were overdispersed, which indicates that the introduction of nucleotide substitutions can be described adequately by a simple stochastic Poisson process.},

The method is applicable under a wide range of evolutionary models, and to illustrate its usefulness in practice, we embed it within a data augmentation-based Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, for approximating posterior distributions under previously proposed codon substitution models. The sampler is found to be more efficient than the conventional pruning-based sampler with the decorrelation times between draws from the posterior reduced by a factor of 20 or more.},

	Abstract = {A safe and effective HIV-1 vaccine is urgently needed to control the worldwide AIDS epidemic. Traditional methods of vaccine development have been frustratingly slow, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that radical new approaches may be required. Computational and mathematical approaches, combined with evolutionary reasoning, may provide new insights for the design of an efficacious AIDS vaccine. Here, we used codon-based substitution models and maximum-likelihood (ML) methods to identify positively selected sites that are likely to be involved in the immune control of HIV-1. Analysis of subtypes B and C revealed widespread adaptive evolution. Positively selected amino acids were detected in all nine HIV-1 proteins, including Env. Of particular interest was the high level of positive selection within the C-terminal regions of the immediate-early regulatory proteins, Tat and Rev. Many of the amino acid replacements were associated with the emergence of novel (or alternative) myristylation and casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation sites. The impact of these changes on the conformation and antigenicity of Tat and Rev remains to be established. In rhesus macaques, a single CTL-associated amino substitution in Tat has been linked to escape from acute SIV infection. Understanding the relationship between host-driven positive selection and antigenic variation may lead to the development of novel vaccine strategies that preempt the escape process.},

@article{Price1999,
	Abstract = {Efforts to develop immune-based therapies for HIV infection have been impeded by incomplete definition of the immunological correlates of protection. Despite many precedents demonstrating that CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes are key mediators of protective anti-viral immunity in non-human animal models, direct evidence that these effector cells control viral replication in HIV-1 infection has remained elusive. The first part of this paper describes a detailed immunological and genetic study founded on evolutionary considerations. Following infection with HIV-1, virus variants which escaped recognition by autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes were shown to possess a selection advantage within the host environment. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes therefore exert anti-viral pressure in vivo. This observation provides compelling evidence that cytotoxic T lymphocytes comprise a significant element of anti-retroviral immunity. Subsequently, the quantification of peripheral cytotoxic T lymphocyte frequencies utilizing peptide-(human leucocyte antigen class I) tetrameric complexes is described. Five patients with qualitatively similar immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses during symptomatic primary HIV-1 infection were studied longitudinally. Expansions of virus-specific CD8(+) lymphocytes comprising up to 2% of the total CD8(+) T cell population were observed in the acute phase of infection. Antigenic load was identified as an important determinant of circulating HIV-1-specific CD8(+) lymphocyte levels; however, significant numbers of such cells were also found to persist following prolonged therapeutic suppression of plasma viraemia. In addition, an analysis of antigenic sequence variation with time in this case series suggests that the early administration of combination anti-retroviral therapy may limit HIV-1 mutational escape from host cytolytic specificities. The implications of these preliminary data are discussed. The data presented suggest that vaccination protocols should aim to elicit vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to HIV-1. Attempts to stimulate polyvalent responses to mutationally intolerant epitopes are likely to be most effective. Optimal management of HIV-1 infection requires an understanding of dynamic host-virus interactions, and may involve strategies designed to enhance cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity following periods of anti-retroviral drug therapy.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection is associated with a shift in the target cell population, driven by variability in coreceptor utilization resulting from diversity in env. To elucidate the potential consequences of these changes for Env-mediated fusion over the course of AIDS, we examined the biological properties of serial viral isolates and determined coreceptor utilization by the products of env cloned from two individuals, followed from the detection of seroconversion throughout the course of their infection. One had a typical course, and the other had an accelerated progression. Early isolates were non-syncytium inducing, and the corresponding Env exclusively utilized CCR5, whereas Env from late phases of infection showed restricted utilization of CXCR4 in both patients. Env from subject SC24, who had a standard progression, demonstrated multitropism, manifested by utilization of CCR3, CXCR4, and CCR5 in the intervening period. In contrast, Env from patient SC51, who experienced early conversion to the syncytium-inducing phenotype, developed dualtropic coreceptor utilization of CCR5 and CXCR4. Genetic analysis of env from each isolate revealed that those with an X4 phenotype formed a distinct subcluster within each subject. Analysis of chimeras constructed from R5 and multispecific env from patient SC24 demonstrated that while the V3 domain played a dominant role in determining coreceptor utilization, sequences in the V4-V5 region also contributed to the latter phenotype. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the hybrid Env proteins were expressed at similar levels. These experiments demonstrate that progression from the R5 to X4 phenotype may occur through a multi- or dual-tropic intermediate and that multiple domains contribute to this process.},

The mean half-life of the latent reservoir was very long (43.9 months). If the latent reservoir consists of only 1 x 10(5) cells, eradication could take as long as 60 years.

@article{Lakner2008,
	Abstract = {The main limiting factor in Bayesian MCMC analysis of phylogeny is typically the efficiency with which topology proposals sample tree space. Here we evaluate the performance of seven different proposal mechanisms, including most of those used in current Bayesian phylogenetics software. We sampled 12 empirical nucleotide data sets--ranging in size from 27 to 71 taxa and from 378 to 2,520 sites--under difficult conditions: short runs, no Metropolis-coupling, and an oversimplified substitution model producing difficult tree spaces (Jukes Cantor with equal site rates). Convergence was assessed by comparison to reference samples obtained from multiple Metropolis-coupled runs. We find that proposals producing topology changes as a side effect of branch length changes (LOCAL and Continuous Change) consistently perform worse than those involving stochastic branch rearrangements (nearest neighbor interchange, subtree pruning and regrafting, tree bisection and reconnection, or subtree swapping). Among the latter, moves that use an extension mechanism to mix local with more distant rearrangements show better overall performance than those involving only local or only random rearrangements. Moves with only local rearrangements tend to mix well but have long burn-in periods, whereas moves with random rearrangements often show the reverse pattern. Combinations of moves tend to perform better than single moves. The time to convergence can be shortened considerably by starting with a good tree, but this comes at the cost of compromising convergence diagnostics based on overdispersed starting points. Our results have important implications for developers of Bayesian MCMC implementations and for the large group of users of Bayesian phylogenetics software.},

Of particular interest is the role of population size on genetic draft. Remarkably, the rate of substitution of weakly selected advantageous mutations decreases with increasing population size, whereas that for deleterious mutations increases with population size. This dependency on population size is the opposite of that for genetic drift. Moreover, these rates are only weakly dependent on population size, again contrary to the strong dependency of drift-based dynamics. Four models of the strongly selected loci responsible for genetic draft are examined. Three of these exhibit a very weak dependency on population size, which implies that their induced effects will also be weakly dependent on population size. Together, these results suggest that population size and binomial sampling may not be relevant to a species' evolution. If this is the case, then a number of evolutionary conundrums are resolved.},

This software platform is a re-design of the popular BEAST 1 platform to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format.},

	Abstract = {Information on global human movement patterns is central to spatial epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of influenza and other infectious diseases. Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone. Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses, but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility, mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host movement can be combined. Here, we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide. Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows, whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance. Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global influenza diversity. By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated. In conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control.},

	Abstract = {In phylogenetic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral gene transfer, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.},

	Abstract = {The timing of the evolution of microbial life has largely remained elusive due to the scarcity of prokaryotic fossil record and the confounding effects of the exchange of genes among possibly distant species. The history of gene transfer events, however, is not a series of individual oddities; it records which lineages were concurrent and thus provides information on the timing of species diversification. Here, we use a probabilistic model of genome evolution that accounts for differences between gene phylogenies and the species tree as series of duplication, transfer, and loss events to reconstruct chronologically ordered species phylogenies. Using simulations we show that we can robustly recover accurate chronologically ordered species phylogenies in the presence of gene tree reconstruction errors and realistic rates of duplication, transfer, and loss. Using genomic data we demonstrate that we can infer rooted species phylogenies using homologous gene families from complete genomes of 10 bacterial and archaeal groups. Focusing on cyanobacteria, distinguished among prokaryotes by a relative abundance of fossils, we infer the maximum likelihood chronologically ordered species phylogeny based on 36 genomes with 8,332 homologous gene families. We find the order of speciation events to be in full agreement with the fossil record and the inferred phylogeny of cyanobacteria to be consistent with the phylogeny recovered from established phylogenomics methods. Our results demonstrate that lateral gene transfers, detected by probabilistic models of genome evolution, can be used as a source of information on the timing of evolution, providing a valuable complement to the limited prokaryotic fossil record.},

	Abstract = {Lateral gene transfer (LGT)-which transfers DNA between two non-vertically related individuals belonging to the same or different species-is recognized as a major force in prokaryotic evolution, and evidence of its impact on eukaryotic evolution is ever increasing. LGT has attracted much public attention for its potential to transfer pathogenic elements and antibiotic resistance in bacteria, and to transfer pesticide resistance from genetically modified crops to other plants. In a wider perspective, there is a growing body of studies highlighting the role of LGT in enabling organisms to occupy new niches or adapt to environmental changes. The challenge LGT poses to the standard tree-based conception of evolution is also being debated. Studies of LGT have, however, been severely limited by a lack of computational tools. The best currently available LGT algorithms are parsimony-based phylogenetic methods, which require a pre-computed gene tree and cannot choose between sometimes wildly differing most parsimonious solutions. Moreover, in many studies, simple heuristics are applied that can only handle putative orthologs and completely disregard gene duplications (GDs). Consequently, proposed LGT among specific gene families, and the rate of LGT in general, remain debated. We present a Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo-based method that integrates GD, gene loss, LGT, and sequence evolution, and apply the method in a genome-wide analysis of two groups of bacteria: Mollicutes and Cyanobacteria. Our analyses show that although the LGT rate between distant species is high, the net combined rate of duplication and close-species LGT is on average higher. We also show that the common practice of disregarding reconcilability in gene tree inference overestimates the number of LGT and duplication events.

	Abstract = {The temporal dynamics of species diversity are shaped by variations in the rates of speciation and extinction, and there is a long history of inferring these rates using first and last appearances of taxa in the fossil record. Understanding diversity dynamics critically depends on unbiased estimates of the unobserved times of speciation and extinction for all lineages, but the inference of these parameters is challenging due to the complex nature of the available data. Here, we present a new probabilistic framework to jointly estimate species-specific times of speciation and extinction and the rates of the underlying birth-death process based on the fossil record. The rates are allowed to vary through time independently of each other, and the probability of preservation and sampling is explicitly incorporated in the model to estimate the true lifespan of each lineage. We implement a Bayesian algorithm to assess the presence of rate shifts by exploring alternative diversification models. Tests on a range of simulated data sets reveal the accuracy and robustness of our approach against violations of the underlying assumptions and various degrees of data incompleteness. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our method with the diversification of the mammal family Rhinocerotidae and reveal a complex history of repeated and independent temporal shifts of both speciation and extinction rates, leading to the expansion and subsequent decline of the group. The estimated parameters of the birth-death process implemented here are directly comparable with those obtained from dated molecular phylogenies. Thus, our model represents a step towards integrating phylogenetic and fossil information to infer macroevolutionary processes.[BDMCMC; biodiversity trends; Birth-death process; incomplete fossil sampling; macroevolution; species rise and fall.].},

Hence, we develop a phylodynamic method that enables the joint estimation of epidemiological parameters and phylogenetic history. Based on a compartmental susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, this method provides separate information on incidence and prevalence of infections. Detailed information on the interaction of host population dynamics and evolutionary history can inform decisions on how to contain or entirely avoid disease outbreaks. We apply our birth-death SIR method to two viral datasets. First, five HIV type 1 clusters sampled in the UK between 1999 and 2003 are analysed. The estimated basic reproduction ratios range from 1.9 to 3.2 among the clusters. All clusters show a decline in the growth rate of the local epidemic in the middle or end of the 1990s. The analysis of a hepatitis C virus genotype 2c dataset shows that the local epidemic in the C{\'o}rdoban city Cruz del Eje originated around 1906 (median), coinciding with an immigration wave from Europe to central Argentina that dates from 1880 to 1920.

	Abstract = {Transmission events are the fundamental building blocks of the dynamics of any infectious disease. Much about the epidemiology of a disease can be learned when these individual transmission events are known or can be estimated. Such estimations are difficult and generally feasible only when detailed epidemiological data are available. The genealogy estimated from genetic sequences of sampled pathogens is another rich source of information on transmission history. Optimal inference of transmission events calls for the combination of genetic data and epidemiological data into one joint analysis. A key difficulty is that the transmission tree, which describes the transmission events between infected hosts, differs from the phylogenetic tree, which describes the ancestral relationships between pathogens sampled from these hosts. The trees differ both in timing of the internal nodes and in topology. These differences become more pronounced when a higher fraction of infected hosts is sampled. We show how the phylogenetic tree of sampled pathogens is related to the transmission tree of an outbreak of an infectious disease, by the within-host dynamics of pathogens. We provide a statistical framework to infer key epidemiological and mutational parameters by simultaneously estimating the phylogenetic tree and the transmission tree. We test the approach using simulations and illustrate its use on an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The approach unifies existing methods in the emerging field of phylodynamics with transmission tree reconstruction methods that are used in infectious disease epidemiology.},

	Abstract = {The extent to which natural selection shapes diversity within populations is a key question for population genetics. Thus, there is considerable interest in quantifying the strength of selection. A full likelihood approach for inference about selection at a single site within an otherwise neutral fully linked sequence of sites is described here. A coalescent model of evolution is used to model the ancestry of a sample of DNA sequences which have the selected site segregating. The mutation model, for the selected and neutral sites, is the infinitely many-sites model where there is no back or parallel mutation at sites. A unique perfect phylogeny, a gene tree, can be constructed from the configuration of mutations on the sample sequences under this model of mutation. The approach is general and can be used for any bi-allelic selection scheme. Selection is incorporated through modelling the frequency of the selected and neutral allelic classes stochastically back in time, then using a subdivided population model considering the population frequencies through time as variable population sizes. An importance sampling algorithm is then used to explore over coalescent tree space consistent with the data. The method is applied to a simulated data set and the gene tree presented in Verrelli et al. (2002).},

Existing methods for estimating these parameters from cross-sectional population data using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) ignore information about the genealogy of sampled HIV sequences, which has the potential to cause systematic bias and overestimate certainty. Here, we describe an integrated approach, validated through extensive simulations, which combines genealogical inference and epidemiological modelling, to estimate rates of CTL escape and reversion in HIV epitopes. We show that there is substantial uncertainty about rates of viral escape and reversion from cross-sectional data, which arises from the inherent stochasticity in the evolutionary process. By application to empirical data, we find that point estimates of rates from a previously published ODE model and the integrated approach presented here are often similar, but can also differ several-fold depending on the structure of the genealogy. The model-based approach we apply provides a framework for the statistical analysis and hypothesis testing of escape and reversion in population data and highlights the need for longitudinal and denser cross-sectional sampling to enable accurate estimate of these key parameters.},

	Abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of infections that has undergone rapid global spread over recent decades. Formal phylogeographic methods have not yet been applied to the molecular epidemiology of bacterial pathogens because the limited genetic diversity of data sets based on individual genes usually results in poor phylogenetic resolution. Here, we investigated a whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data set of health care-associated Methicillin-resistant S. aureus sequence type 239 (HA-MRSA ST239) strains, which we analyzed using Markov spatial models that incorporate geographical sampling distributions. The reconstructed timescale indicated a temporal origin of this strain shortly after the introduction of Methicillin, followed by global pandemic spread. The estimate of the temporal origin was robust to the molecular clock, coalescent prior, full/intergenic/synonymous SNP inclusion, and correction for excluded invariant site patterns. Finally, phylogeographic analyses statistically supported the role of human movement in the global dissemination of HA-MRSA ST239, although it was unable to conclusively resolve the location of the root. This study demonstrates that bacterial genomes can indeed contain sufficient evolutionary information to elucidate the temporal and spatial dynamics of transmission. Future applications of this approach to other bacterial strains may provide valuable epidemiological insights that may justify the cost of genome-wide typing.},

@article{Rasmussen:2011qa,
	Abstract = {Phylodynamics - the field aiming to quantitatively integrate the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of rapidly evolving populations like those of RNA viruses - increasingly relies upon coalescent approaches to infer past population dynamics from reconstructed genealogies. As sequence data have become more abundant, these approaches are beginning to be used on populations undergoing rapid and rather complex dynamics. In such cases, the simple demographic models that current phylodynamic methods employ can be limiting. First, these models are not ideal for yielding biological insight into the processes that drive the dynamics of the populations of interest. Second, these models differ in form from mechanistic and often stochastic population dynamic models that are currently widely used when fitting models to time series data. As such, their use does not allow for both genealogical data and time series data to be considered in tandem when conducting inference. Here, we present a flexible statistical framework for phylodynamic inference that goes beyond these current limitations. The framework we present employs a recently developed method known as particle MCMC to fit stochastic, nonlinear mechanistic models for complex population dynamics to gene genealogies and time series data in a Bayesian framework. We demonstrate our approach using a nonlinear Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease and show through simulations that it provides accurate estimates of past disease dynamics and key epidemiological parameters from genealogies with or without accompanying time series data.},

	Abstract = {Since its introduction in 2001, MrBayes has grown in popularity as a software package for Bayesian phylogenetic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. With this note, we announce the release of version 3.2, a major upgrade to the latest official release presented in 2003. The new version provides convergence diagnostics and allows multiple analyses to be run in parallel with convergence progress monitored on the fly. The introduction of new proposals and automatic optimization of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many problems. The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood calculations through streaming single-instruction-multiple-data extensions (SSE) and support of the BEAGLE library, allowing likelihood calculations to be delegated to graphics processing units (GPUs) on compatible hardware. Speedup factors range from around 2 with SSE code to more than 50 with BEAGLE for codon problems. Checkpointing across all models allows long runs to be completed even when an analysis is prematurely terminated. New models include relaxed clocks, dating, model averaging across time-reversible substitution models, and support for hard, negative, and partial (backbone) tree constraints. Inference of species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation of the Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) algorithms. Marginal model likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be estimated accurately across the entire model space using the stepping stone method. The new version provides more output options than previously, including samples of ancestral states, site rates, site d(N)/d(S) rations, branch rates, and node dates. A wide range of statistics on tree parameters can also be output for visualization in FigTree and compatible software.},

To infer past population dynamics from molecular sequence data, coalescent-based models have been developed for Bayesian nonparametric estimation of effective population size over time. Among the most successful is a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) model for a single gene locus. Here, we present a generalization of the GMRF model that allows for the analysis of multilocus sequence data. Using simulated data, we demonstrate the improved performance of our method to recover true population trajectories and the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). We analyze a multilocus alignment of HIV-1 CRF02_AG gene sequences sampled from Cameroon. Our results are consistent with HIV prevalence data and uncover some aspects of the population history that go undetected in Bayesian parametric estimation. Finally, we recover an older and more reconcilable TMRCA for a classic ancient DNA data set.},

	Abstract = {Some statistical properties of samples of DNA sequences are studied under an infinite-site neutral model with recombination. The two quantities of interest are R, the number of recombination events in the history of a sample of sequences, and RM, the number of recombination events that can be parsimoniously inferred from a sample of sequences. Formulas are derived for the mean and variance of R. In contrast to R, RM can be determined from the sample. Since no formulas are known for the mean and variance of RM, they are estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that RM is often much less than R, therefore, the number of recombination events may be greatly under-estimated in a parsimonious reconstruction of the history of a sample. The statistic RM can be used to estimate the product of the recombination rate and the population size or, if the recombination rate is known, to estimate the population size. To illustrate this, DNA sequences from the Adh region of Drosophila melanogaster are used to estimate the effective population size of this species.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the relationship between probabilities of identity by descent and the distribution of coalescence times. By using the relationship between coalescence times and identity probabilities, it is possible to extend existing results for inbreeding coefficients in regular systems of mating to find the distribution of coalescence times and the mean coalescence times. It is also possible to express Sewall Wright's FST as the ratio of average coalescence times of different pairs of genes. That simplifies the analysis of models of subdivided populations because the average coalescence time can be found by computing separately the time it takes for two genes to enter a single subpopulation and time it takes for two genes in the same subpopulation to coalesce. The first time depends only on the migration matrix and the second time depends only on the total number of individuals in the population. This approach is used to find FST in the finite island model and in one- and two-dimensional stepping-stone models. It is also used to find the rate of approach of FST to its equilibrium value. These results are discussed in terms of different measures of genetic distance. It is proposed that, for the purposes of describing the amount of gene flow among local populations, the effective migration rate between pairs of local populations, M, which is the migration rate that would be estimated for those two populations if they were actually in an island model, provides a simple and useful measure of genetic similarity that can be defined for either allozyme or DNA sequence data.},

It was found that the consistency probability thus derived substantially increases as the sample size of genes increases, unless the divergence time of populations is very long compared to population sizes.

The statistical property of the number of nucleotide differences between randomly chosen nucleons and that of heterozygosity or nucleon diversity is investigated using this theory. These studies indicate that the estimates of the average number of nucleotide differences and nucleon diversity have a large variance, and a large part of this variance is due to stochastic factors.

	Abstract = {Ease and accuracy of typing, together with high levels of polymorphism and widespread distribution in the genome, make microsatellite (or short tandem repeat) loci an attractive potential source of information about both population histories and evolutionary processes. However, microsatellite data are difficult to interpret, in particular because of the frequency of back-mutations. Stochastic models for the underlying genetic processes can be specified, but in the past they have been too complicated for direct analysis. Recent developments in stochastic simulation methodology now allow direct inference about both historical events, such as genealogical coalescence times, and evolutionary parameters, such as mutation rates. A feature of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that we propose here is that the likelihood computations are simplified by treating the (unknown) ancestral allelic states as auxiliary parameters. We illustrate the algorithm by analyzing microsatellite samples simulated under the model. Our results suggest that a single microsatellite usually does not provide enough information for useful inferences, but that several completely linked microsatellites can be informative about some aspects of genealogical history and evolutionary processes. We also reanalyze data from a previously published human Y chromosome microsatellite study, finding evidence for an effective population size for human Y chromosomes in the low thousands and a recent time since their most recent common ancestor: the 95% interval runs from approximately 15, 000 to 130,000 years, with most likely values around 30,000 years.},

The Kingman coalescent model is used to describe the time structure of the ancestral tree. We recover information about the unknown true ancestral coalescent tree, population size, and the overall mutation rate from temporally spaced data, that is, from nucleotide sequences gathered at different times, from different individuals, in an evolving haploid population. We briefly discuss the methodological implications and show what can be inferred, in various practically relevant states of prior knowledge. We develop extensions for exponentially growing population size and joint estimation of substitution model parameters.

	Abstract = {It is well known that a phylogenetic tree (gene tree) constructed from DNA sequences for a genetic locus does not necessarily agree with the tree that represents the actual evolutionary pathway of the species involved (species tree). One of the important factors that cause this difference is genetic polymorphism in the ancestral species. Under the assumption of neutral mutations, this problem can be studied by evaluating the probability (P) that a gene tree has the same topology as that of the species tree. When one gene (allele) is used from each of the species involved, the probability can be expressed as a simple function of Ti = ti/(2N), where ti is the evolutionary time measured in generations for the ith internodal branch of the species tree and N is the effective population size. When any of the Ti's is less than 1, the probability P becomes considerably less than 1.0. This probability cannot be substantially increased by increasing the number of alleles sampled from a locus. To increase the probability, one has to use DNA sequences from many different loci that have evolved independently of each other.},

	Abstract = {Viral phylodynamics is defined as the study of how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape viralphylogenies. Since the coining of the term in 2004, research on viral phylodynamics has focused on transmission dynamics in an effort to shed light on how these dynamics impact viral genetic variation. Transmission dynamics can be considered at the level of cells within an infected host, individual hosts within a population, or entire populations of hosts. Many viruses, especially RNA viruses, rapidly accumulate genetic variation because of short generation times and high mutation rates. Patterns of viral genetic variation are therefore heavily influenced by how quickly transmission occurs and by which entities transmit to one another. Patterns of viral genetic variation will also be affected by selection acting on viral phenotypes. Although viruses can differ with respect to many phenotypes, phylodynamic studies have to date tended to focus on a limited number of viral phenotypes. These include virulence phenotypes, phenotypes associated with viral transmissibility, cell or tissue tropism phenotypes, and antigenic phenotypes that can facilitate escape from host immunity. Due to the impact that transmission dynamics and selection can have on viral genetic variation, viral phylogenies can therefore be used to investigate important epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes, such as epidemic spread[2], spatio-temporal dynamics including metapopulation dynamics[3], zoonotic transmission, tissue tropism[4], and antigenic drift[5]. The quantitative investigation of these processes through the consideration of viral phylogenies is the central aim of viral phylodynamics.},

To perform this task, we developed mtDNA-GeneSyn, a computer tool that identifies and exhaustedly classifies the diversity present in large genetic data sets. The diversity observed in the 5140 human mitochondrial genomes was compared with all possible transitions and transversions from the standard human mitochondrial reference genome. This comparison showed that tRNA and rRNA secondary structures have a large effect in limiting the diversity of the human mitochondrial sequences, whereas for the protein-coding genes there is a bias toward less variation at the second codon positions. The analysis of the observed amino acid variations showed a tolerance of variations that convert between the amino acids V, I, A, M, and T. This defines a group of amino acids with similar chemical properties that can interconvert by a single transition.},

@article{Redelings:2007fk,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phylogenies of rapidly evolving pathogens can be difficult to resolve because of the small number of substitutions that accumulate in the short times since divergence. To improve resolution of such phylogenies we propose using insertion and deletion (indel) information in addition to substitution information. We accomplish this through joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny in a Bayesian framework, drawing inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny sidesteps biases that stem from conditioning on a single alignment by taking into account the ensemble of near-optimal alignments.
RESULTS: We introduce a novel Markov chain transition kernel that improves computational efficiency by proposing non-local topology rearrangements and by block sampling alignment and topology parameters. In addition, we extend our previous indel model to increase biological realism by placing indels preferentially on longer branches. We demonstrate the ability of indel information to increase phylogenetic resolution in examples drawn from within-host viral sequence samples. We also demonstrate the importance of taking alignment uncertainty into account when using such information. Finally, we show that codon-based substitution models can significantly affect alignment quality and phylogenetic inference by unrealistically forcing indels to begin and end between codons.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that indel information can improve phylogenetic resolution of recently diverged pathogens and that alignment uncertainty should be considered in such analyses.},

We assume that the rate varies among sites according to an invariant+gamma distribution, which has two parameters: the gamma parameter alpha and the proportion of invariable sites theta. Theoretical treatments on three, four, and five sequences have been conducted, and computer program have been developed. It is shown that rho = (1 + theta alpha)/(1 + alpha) is a good measure for the rate heterogeneity among sites. Extensive simulations show that (1) if the proportion of invariable sites is negligible, i.e., theta = 0, the gamma parameter alpha can be satisfactorily estimated, even with three sequences; (2) if the proportion of invariable sites is not negligible, the heterogeneity rho can still be suitably estimated with four or more sequences; and (3) the distances estimated by the proposed method are almost unbiased and are robust against violation of the assumption of the invariant + gamma distribution.},

First, I present several methods for constructing confidence intervals for the speciation rate under the simple assumption of a pure birth process. I discuss the relationships among these methods in the hope of clarifying some fundamental theory in this area. Their performances are compared in a simulation study and one is recommended for use as a result. A variety of other questions that may, in fact, be the questions of primary interest (e.g., Has the rate of cladogenesis been declining?) are then recast as biological variants of the purely statistical question-Is the birth process model appropriate for my data? Seen in this way, a preexisting arsenal of statistical techniques is opened up for use in this area: in particular, techniques developed for the analysis of Poisson processes and the analysis of survival data. These two approaches start from different representations of the data--the branch lengths in the tree--and I explicitly relate the two. Aiming for a synoptic account of useful theory in this area, I briefly discuss some important results from the analysis of two distinct birth-death processes: the one introduced into this area by Hey (1992) is refitted with some powerful statistical tools.},

To study this proposal further, two hypervariable segments of mtDNA were sequenced from 189 people of diverse geographic origin, including 121 native Africans. Geographic specificity was observed in that identical mtDNA types are shared within but not between populations. A tree relating these mtDNA sequences to one another and to a chimpanzee sequence has many deep branches leading exclusively to African mtDNAs. An African origin for human mtDNA is supported by two statistical tests. With the use of the chimpanzee and human sequences to calibrate the rate of mtDNA evolution, the age of the common human mtDNA ancestor is placed between 166,000 and 249,000 years. These results thus support and extend the African origin hypothesis of human mtDNA evolution.},

The amino acid sequences of hemoglobins from humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and rhesus monkeys are consistent with the hypothesis that the probability of an amino acid substitution occurring in a given interval of time is the same for every hemoglobin lineage. This allows the use of these data as a hemoglobin evolutionary clock, just as we have previously done with the albumins. It is shown that concordance exists between the hemoglobin and albumin results and that both support the suggestion that the human lineage diverged from that leading to the African apes far more recently than is generally supposed.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Comparative modeling of RNA is known to be important for making accurate secondary structure predictions. RNA structure prediction tools such as PPfold or RNAalifold use an aligned set of sequences in predictions. Obtaining a multiple alignment from a set of sequences is quite a challenging problem itself, and the quality of the alignment can affect the quality of a prediction. By implementing RNA secondary structure prediction in a statistical alignment framework, and predicting structures from multiple alignment samples instead of a single fixed alignment, it may be possible to improve predictions. RESULTS: We have extended the program StatAlign to make use of RNA-specific features, which include RNA secondary structure prediction from multiple alignments using either a thermodynamic approach (RNAalifold) or a Stochastic Context-Free Grammars (SCFGs) approach (PPfold). We also provide the user with scores relating to the quality of a secondary structure prediction, such as information entropy values for the combined space of secondary structures and sampled alignments, and a reliability score that predicts the expected number of correctly predicted base pairs. Finally, we have created RNA secondary structure visualization plugins and automated the process of setting up Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs for RNA alignments in StatAlign.Availability and implementation: The software is available from http://statalign.github.com/statalign/.Contact: novak@stats.ox.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Bayesian analysis is one of the most popular methods in phylogenetic inference. The most commonly used methods fix a single multiple alignment and consider only substitutions as phylogenetically informative mutations, though alignments and phylogenies should be inferred jointly as insertions and deletions also carry informative signals. Methods addressing these issues have been developed only recently and there has not been so far a user-friendly program with a graphical interface that implements these methods. RESULTS: We have developed an extendable software package in the Java programming language that samples from the joint posterior distribution of phylogenies, alignments and evolutionary parameters by applying the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The package also offers tools for efficient on-the-fly summarization of the results.

The background model for insertions and deletions can be combined with any substitution model. It is easy to add new substitution models to the software package as plugins.

	Abstract = {We describe a new program for the alignment of multiple biological sequences that is both statistically motivated and fast enough for problem sizes that arise in practice. Our Fast Statistical Alignment program is based on pair hidden Markov models which approximate an insertion/deletion process on a tree and uses a sequence annealing algorithm to combine the posterior probabilities estimated from these models into a multiple alignment. FSA uses its explicit statistical model to produce multiple alignments which are accompanied by estimates of the alignment accuracy and uncertainty for every column and character of the alignment--previously available only with alignment programs which use computationally-expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches--yet can align thousands of long sequences. Moreover, FSA utilizes an unsupervised query-specific learning procedure for parameter estimation which leads to improved accuracy on benchmark reference alignments in comparison to existing programs. The centroid alignment approach taken by FSA, in combination with its learning procedure, drastically reduces the amount of false-positive alignment on biological data in comparison to that given by other methods. The FSA program and a companion visualization tool for exploring uncertainty in alignments can be used via a web interface at http://orangutan.math.berkeley.edu/fsa/, and the source code is available at http://fsa.sourceforge.net/.},

However, in particular for sexually transmitted diseases, quantitative data on population contact structure are hard to obtain. Here, we introduce a new method that quantifies host population structure based on phylogenetic trees, which are obtained from pathogen genetic sequence data. Our method is based on a maximum-likelihood framework and uses a multi-type branching process, under which each host is assigned to a type (subpopulation). In a simulation study, we show that our method produces accurate parameter estimates for phylogenetic trees in which each tip is assigned to a type, as well for phylogenetic trees in which the type of the tip is unknown. We apply the method to a Latvian HIV-1 dataset, quantifying the impact of the intravenous drug user epidemic on the heterosexual epidemic (known tip states), and identifying superspreader dynamics within the men-having-sex-with-men epidemic (unknown tip states).},

	Abstract = {Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the most important cause of acute respiratory disease in infants. Two major subgroups (A and B) have been identified based on antigenic differences in the attachment G protein. Antigenic variation between and within the subgroups may contribute to reinfections with these viruses by evading the host immune responses. To investigate the circulation patterns and mechanisms by which HRSV-B viruses evolve, we analyzed the G protein genetic variability of subgroup B sequences isolated over a 45-year period, including 196 Belgian strains obtained over 22 epidemic seasons (1982 to 2004). Our study revealed that the HRSV-B evolutionary rate (1.95 x 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions/site/year) is similar to that previously estimated for HRSV-A (1.83 x 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions/site/year). However, natural HRSV-B isolates appear to accommodate more drastic changes in their attachment G proteins. The most recent common ancestor of the currently circulating subgroup B strains was estimated to date back to around the year 1949. The divergence between the two major subgroups was calculated to have occurred approximately 350 years ago. Furthermore, we have identified 12 positively selected sites in the G protein ectodomain, suggesting that immune-driven selective pressure operates in certain codon positions. HRSV-A and -B strains have similar phylodynamic patterns: both subgroups are characterized by global spatiotemporal strain dynamics, where the high infectiousness of HRSV permits the rapid geographic spread of novel strain variants.},

	Abstract = {Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the most common etiological agent of acute lower respiratory tract disease in infants and can cause repeated infections throughout life. In this study, we have analyzed nucleotide sequences encompassing 629 bp at the carboxy terminus of the G glycoprotein gene for HRSV subgroup A strains isolated over 47 years, including 112 Belgian strains isolated over 19 consecutive years (1984 to 2002). By using a maximum likelihood method, we have tested the presence of diversifying selection and identified 13 positively selected sites with a posterior probability above 0.5. The sites under positive selection correspond to sites of O glycosylation or to amino acids that were previously described as monoclonal antibody-induced in vitro escape mutants. Our findings suggest that the evolution of subgroup A HRSV G glycoprotein is driven by immune pressure operating in certain codon positions located mainly in the second hypervariable region of the ectodomain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the prolonged cocirculation of two subgroup A lineages among the Belgian population and the possible extinction of three other lineages. The evolutionary rate of HRSV subgroup A isolates was estimated to be 1.83 x 10(-3) nucleotide substitutions/site/year, projecting the most recent common ancestor back to the early 1940s.},

	Abstract = {We provide a framework for Bayesian coalescent inference from microsatellite data that enables inference of population history parameters averaged over microsatellite mutation models. To achieve this we first implemented a rich family of microsatellite mutation models and related components in the software package BEAST. BEAST is a powerful tool that performs Bayesian MCMC analysis on molecular data to make coalescent and evolutionary inferences. Our implementation permits the application of existing nonparametric methods to microsatellite data. The implemented microsatellite models are based on the replication slippage mechanism and focus on three properties of microsatellite mutation: length dependency of mutation rate, mutational bias toward expansion or contraction, and number of repeat units changed in a single mutation event. We develop a new model that facilitates microsatellite model averaging and Bayesian model selection by transdimensional MCMC. With Bayesian model averaging, the posterior distributions of population history parameters are integrated across a set of microsatellite models and thus account for model uncertainty. Simulated data are used to evaluate our method in terms of accuracy and precision of estimation and also identification of the true mutation model. Finally we apply our method to a red colobus monkey data set as an example.},

More recently, Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo has become the dominant method of divergence time estimation, and fossil evidence has been reinterpreted as the specification of prior distributions on the divergence times of calibration nodes. These so-called "soft calibrations" have become widely used but the statistical properties of calibrated tree priors in a Bayesian setting hashave not been carefully investigated. Here, we clarify that calibration densities, such as those defined in BEAST 1.5, do not represent the marginal prior distribution of the calibration node. We illustrate this with a number of analytical results on small trees. We also describe an alternative construction for a calibrated Yule prior on trees that allows direct specification of the marginal prior distribution of the calibrated divergence time, with or without the restriction of monophyly. This method requires the computation of the Yule prior conditional on the height of the divergence being calibrated. Unfortunately, a practical solution for multiple calibrations remains elusive. Our results suggest that direct estimation of the prior induced by specifying multiple calibration densities should be a prerequisite of any divergence time dating analysis.},

	Abstract = {Epidemic modeling of infectious diseases has a long history in both theoretical and empirical research. However the recent explosion of genetic data has revealed the rapid rate of evolution that many populations of infectious agents undergo and has underscored the need to consider both evolutionary and ecological processes on the same time scale. Mathematical epidemiology has applied dynamical models to study infectious epidemics, but these models have tended not to exploit - or take into account - evolutionary changes and their effect on the ecological processes and population dynamics of the infectious agent. On the other hand, statistical phylogenetics has increasingly been applied to the study of infectious agents. This approach is based on phylogenetics, molecular clocks, genealogy-based population genetics and phylogeography. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo and related computational tools have been the primary source of advances in these statistical phylogenetic approaches. Recently the first tentative steps have been taken to reconcile these two theoretical approaches. We survey the Bayesian phylogenetic approach to epidemic modeling of infection diseases and describe the contrasts it provides to mathematical epidemiology as well as emphasize the significance of the future unification of these two fields.},

	Abstract = {A method for studying the divergence of multiple closely related populations is described and assessed. The approach of Hey and Nielsen (2007, Integration within the Felsenstein equation for improved Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in population genetics. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 104:2785-2790) for fitting an isolation-with-migration model was extended to the case of multiple populations with a known phylogeny. Analysis of simulated data sets reveals the kinds of history that are accessible with a multipopulation analysis. Necessarily, processes associated with older time periods in a phylogeny are more difficult to estimate; and histories with high levels of gene flow are particularly difficult with more than two populations. However, for histories with modest levels of gene flow, or for very large data sets, it is possible to study large complex divergence problems that involve multiple closely related populations or species.},

	Abstract = {The estimation of species trees (phylogenies) is one of the most important problems in evolutionary biology, and recently, there has been greater appreciation of the need to estimate species trees directly rather than using gene trees as a surrogate. A Bayesian method constructed under the multispecies coalescent model can consistently estimate species trees but involves intensive computation, which can hinder its application to the phylogenetic analysis of large-scale genomic data. Many summary statistics-based approaches, such as shallowest coalescences (SC) and Global LAteSt Split (GLASS), have been developed to infer species phylogenies for multilocus data sets. In this paper, we propose 2 methods, species tree estimation using average ranks of coalescences (STAR) and species tree estimation using average coalescence times (STEAC), based on the summary statistics of coalescence times. It can be shown that the 2 methods are statistically consistent under the multispecies coalescent model. STAR uses the ranks of coalescences and is thus resistant to variable substitution rates along the branches in gene trees. A simulation study suggests that STAR consistently outperforms STEAC, SC, and GLASS when the substitution rates among lineages are highly variable. Two real genomic data sets were analyzed by the 2 methods and produced species trees that are consistent with previous results.},

	Abstract = {We review recent models to estimate phylogenetic trees under the multispecies coalescent. Although the distinction between gene trees and species trees has come to the fore of phylogenetics, only recently have methods been developed that explicitly estimate species trees. Of the several factors that can cause gene tree heterogeneity and discordance with the species tree, deep coalescence due to random genetic drift in branches of the species tree has been modeled most thoroughly. Bayesian approaches to estimating species trees utilizes two likelihood functions, one of which has been widely used in traditional phylogenetics and involves the model of nucleotide substitution, and the second of which is less familiar to phylogeneticists and involves the probability distribution of gene trees given a species tree. Other recent parametric and nonparametric methods for estimating species trees involve parsimony criteria, summary statistics, supertree and consensus methods. Species tree approaches are an appropriate goal for systematics, appear to work well in some cases where concatenation can be misleading, and suggest that sampling many independent loci will be paramount. Such methods can also be challenging to implement because of the complexity of the models and computational time. In addition, further elaboration of the simplest of coalescent models will be required to incorporate commonly known issues such as deviation from the molecular clock, gene flow and other genetic forces.},

@article{Liu:2008kx,
	Abstract = {Several techniques, such as concatenation and consensus methods, are available for combining data from multiple loci to produce a single statement of phylogenetic relationships. However, when multiple alleles are sampled from individual species, it becomes more challenging to estimate relationships at the level of species, either because concatenation becomes inappropriate due to conflicts among individual gene trees, or because the species from which multiple alleles have been sampled may not form monophyletic groups in the estimated tree. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct species trees from multiple-allele, multilocus sequence data, building on a recently proposed method for estimating species trees from single allele multilocus data. A two-step Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is adopted to estimate the posterior distribution of the species tree. The model is applied to estimate the posterior distribution of species trees for two multiple-allele datasets--yeast (Saccharomyces) and birds (Manacus-manakins). The estimates of the species trees using our method are consistent with those inferred from other methods and genetic markers, but in contrast to other species tree methods, it provides credible regions for the species tree. The Bayesian approach described here provides a powerful framework for statistical testing and integration of population genetics and phylogenetics.},

@article{Edwards:2007uq,
	Abstract = {The vast majority of phylogenetic models focus on resolution of gene trees, despite the fact that phylogenies of species in which gene trees are embedded are of primary interest. We analyze a Bayesian model for estimating species trees that accounts for the stochastic variation expected for gene trees from multiple unlinked loci sampled from a single species history after a coalescent process. Application of the model to a 106-gene data set from yeast shows that the set of gene trees recovered by statistically acknowledging the shared but unknown species tree from which gene trees are sampled is much reduced compared with treating the history of each locus independently of an overarching species tree. The analysis also yields a concentrated posterior distribution of the yeast species tree whose mode is congruent with the concatenated gene tree but can do so with less than half the loci required by the concatenation method. Using simulations, we show that, with large numbers of loci, highly resolved species trees can be estimated under conditions in which concatenation of sequence data will positively mislead phylogeny, and when the proportion of gene trees matching the species tree is <10%. However, when gene tree/species tree congruence is high, species trees can be resolved with just two or three loci. These results make accessible an alternative paradigm for combining data in phylogenomics that focuses attention on the singularity of species histories and away from the idiosyncrasies and multiplicities of individual gene histories.},

@article{Heled:2010fk,
	Abstract = {Until recently, it has been common practice for a phylogenetic analysis to use a single gene sequence from a single individual organism as a proxy for an entire species. With technological advances, it is now becoming more common to collect data sets containing multiple gene loci and multiple individuals per species. These data sets often reveal the need to directly model intraspecies polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting in phylogenetic estimation procedures. For a single species, coalescent theory is widely used in contemporary population genetics to model intraspecific gene trees. Here, we present a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method for the multispecies coalescent. Our method coestimates multiple gene trees embedded in a shared species tree along with the effective population size of both extant and ancestral species. The inference is made possible by multilocus data from multiple individuals per species. Using a multiindividual data set and a series of simulations of rapid species radiations, we demonstrate the efficacy of our new method. These simulations give some insight into the behavior of the method as a function of sampled individuals, sampled loci, and sequence length. Finally, we compare our new method to both an existing method (BEST 2.2) with similar goals and the supermatrix (concatenation) method. We demonstrate that both BEST and our method have much better estimation accuracy for species tree topology than concatenation, and our method outperforms BEST in divergence time and population size estimation.},

	Abstract = {Identifying the specific genetic characteristics of successfully transmitted variants may prove central to the development of effective vaccine and microbicide interventions. Although human immunodeficiency virus transmission is associated with a population bottleneck, the extent to which different factors influence the diversity of transmitted viruses is unclear. We estimate here the number of transmitted variants in 69 heterosexual men and women with primary subtype C infections. From 1,505 env sequences obtained using a single genome amplification approach we show that 78\% of infections involved single variant transmission and 22\% involved multiple variant transmissions (median of 3). We found evidence for mutations selected for cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte or antibody escape and a high prevalence of recombination in individuals infected with multiple variants representing another potential escape pathway in these individuals. In a combined analysis of 171 subtype B and C transmission events, we found that infection with more than one variant does not follow a Poisson distribution, indicating that transmission of individual virions cannot be seen as independent events, each occurring with low probability. While most transmissions resulted from a single infectious unit, multiple variant transmissions represent a significant fraction of transmission events, suggesting that there may be important mechanistic differences between these groups that are not yet understood.},

	Abstract = {Background: A characteristic of Plasmodium falciparum infections is the gradual acquisition of clinical immunity resulting from repeated exposures to the parasite. While the molecular basis of protection against clinical malaria remains unresolved, its effects on epidemiological patterns are well recognized. Accumulating epidemiological data constitute a valuable resource that must be intensively explored and interpreted as to effectively inform control planning.

Methodology/Principal Finding: Here we apply a mathematical model to clinical data from eight endemic regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The model provides a quantitative framework within which differences in age distribution of clinical disease are assessed in terms of the parameters underlying transmission. The shorter infectious periods estimated for clinical infections induce a regime of bistability of endemic and malaria-free states in regions of mesoendemic transmission. The two epidemiological states are separated by a threshold that provides a convenient measure for intervention design. Scenarios of eradication and resurgence are simulated.

Conclusions/Significance: In regions that support mesoendemic transmission, intervention success depends critically on reducing prevalence below a threshold which separates endemic and malaria-free regimes.},

	Abstract = {There is ample theoretical and experimental evidence that virulence evolution depends on the immune response of the host. In this article, we review a number of recent studies that attempt to explicitly incorporate the dynamics of the immune system (instead of merely representing it by a single black box parameter) in models for the evolution of parasite virulence. A striking observation is that the type of infection (acute or chronic) is invariably considered to be a constraint that model assumptions have to satisfy rather than as a potential outcome of the interaction of the parasite with its host's immune system. We argue that avoiding making assumptions about the type of infection will lead to a better understanding of infectious diseases, even though a number of fundamental and technical problems remain. Dynamical modeling of the immune system opens a wide range of perspectives: for understanding how the immune system eradicates a parasite (which it does for most pathogens but not for all, HIV being a notorious example of a virus that is not completely eliminated), for studying multiple infections through concomitant immunity, for understanding the emergence and evolution of the immune system in animals, and for evolutionary epidemiology in general (e.g., predicting evolutionary consequences of new therapies and public health policies). We conclude by discussing new approaches based on embedded (or nested) models and identify future perspectives for the modeling of infectious diseases.},

I develop an original approach to study intrahost evolutionary dynamics of quantitative disease traits. This approach can be expressed mathematically using the 'Price equation' framework recently developed in evolutionary epidemiology. This framework combines population genetics and within-host population dynamics models to identify trade-offs that affect disease intrahost evolution and to predict short-term evolutionary dynamics of life-history traits. I show that this can be applied to study the evolution of viruses competing for host cells or to study the coevolution between parasites and the immune system of the host. This framework can also easily incorporate experimental data. Studying intrahost evolutionary dynamics provides insight at the within-host level, because it allows us to better understand the course of chronic infections, and at the epidemiological level, because it helps to study multi-scale evolutionary processes. This framework can be used to address important biological issues, from immune escape to disease evolutionary response to treatments.},

	Abstract = {The molecular clock, i.e., constancy of the rate of evolution over time, is commonly assumed in estimating divergence dates. However, this assumption is often violated and has drastic effects on date estimation. Recently, a number of attempts have been made to relax the clock assumption. One approach is to use maximum likelihood, which assigns rates to branches and allows the estimation of both rates and times. An alternative is the Bayes approach, which models the change of the rate over time. A number of models of rate change have been proposed. We have extended and evaluated models of rate evolution, i.e., the lognormal and its recent variant, along with the gamma, the exponential, and the {Ornstein-Uhlenbeck} processes. These models were first applied to a small hominoid data set, where an empirical Bayes approach was used to estimate the hyperparameters that measure the amount of rate variation. Estimation of divergence times was sensitive to these hyperparameters, especially when the assumed model is close to the clock assumption. The rate and date estimates varied little from model to model, although the posterior Bayes factor indicated the {Ornstein-Uhlenbeck} process outperformed the other models. To demonstrate the importance of allowing for rate change across lineages, this general approach was used to analyze a larger data set consisting of the {18S} ribosomal {RNA} gene of 39 metazoan species. We obtained date estimates consistent with paleontological records, the deepest split within the group being about 560 million years ago. Estimates of the rates were in accordance with the Cambrian explosion hypothesis and suggested some more recent lineage-specific bursts of evolution.},

@article{Baccam:2006uq,
	Abstract = {Currently, little is known about the viral kinetics of influenza A during infection within an individual. We utilize a series of mathematical models of increasing complexity, which incorporate target cell limitation and the innate interferon response, to examine influenza A virus kinetics in the upper respiratory tracts of experimentally infected adults. The models were fit to data from an experimental H1N1 influenza A/Hong Kong/123/77 infection and suggest that it is important to include the eclipse phase of the viral life cycle in viral dynamic models. Doing so, we estimate that after a delay of approximately 6 h, infected cells begin producing influenza virus and continue to do so for approximately 5 h. The average lifetime of infected cells is approximately 11 h, and the half-life of free infectious virus is approximately 3 h. We calculated the basic reproductive number, R(0), which indicated that a single infected cell could produce approximately 22 new productive infections. This suggests that antiviral treatments have a large hurdle to overcome in moderating symptoms and limiting infectiousness and that treatment has to be initiated as early as possible. For about 50\% of patients, the curve of viral titer versus time has two peaks. This bimodal behavior can be explained by incorporating the antiviral effects of interferon into the model. Our model also compared well to an additional data set on viral titer after experimental infection and treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, which suggests that such models may prove useful in estimating the efficacies of different antiviral therapies for influenza A infection.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a general recursion for the probability of identity in state of two individuals sampled from a population subject to mutation, migration, and random drift in a two-dimensional continuum. The recursion allows for the interactions induced by density-dependent regulation of the population, which are inevitable in a continuous population. We give explicit series expansions for large neighbourhood size and for low mutation rates respectively and investigate the accuracy of the classical Mal{\'e}cot formula for these general models. When neighbourhood size is small, this formula does not give the identity even over large scales. However, for large neighbourhood size, it is an accurate approximation which summarises the local population structure in terms of three quantities: the effective dispersal rate, sigma(e); the effective population density, rho(e); and a local scale, kappa, at which local interactions become significant. The results are illustrated by simulations.},

	Abstract = {Classical models of gene flow fail in three ways: they cannot explain large-scale patterns; they predict much more genetic diversity than is observed; and they assume that loosely linked genetic loci evolve independently. We propose a new model that deals with these problems. Extinction events kill some fraction of individuals in a region. These are replaced by offspring from a small number of parents, drawn from the preexisting population. This model of evolution forwards in time corresponds to a backwards model, in which ancestral lineages jump to a new location if they are hit by an event, and may coalesce with other lineages that are hit by the same event. We derive an expression for the identity in allelic state, and show that, over scales much larger than the largest event, this converges to the classical value derived by Wright and Mal{\'e}cot. However, rare events that cover large areas cause low genetic diversity, large-scale patterns, and correlations in ancestry between unlinked loci.},

	Abstract = {The global migration patterns of influenza viruses have profound implications for the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the disease. We developed a novel approach to reconstruct the genetic history of human influenza A (H3N2) collected worldwide over 1998 to 2009 and used it to infer the global network of influenza transmission. Consistent with previous models, we find that China and Southeast Asia lie at the center of this global network. However, we also find that strains of influenza circulate outside of Asia for multiple seasons, persisting through dynamic migration between northern and southern regions. The USA acts as the primary hub of temperate transmission and, together with China and Southeast Asia, forms the trunk of influenza's evolutionary tree. These findings suggest that antiviral use outside of China and Southeast Asia may lead to the evolution of long-term local and potentially global antiviral resistance. Our results might also aid the design of surveillance efforts and of vaccines better tailored to different geographic regions.},

@article{beerli:2004ef,
	Abstract = {Current estimators of gene flow come in two methods; those that estimate parameters assuming that the populations investigated are a small random sample of a large number of populations and those that assume that all populations were sampled. Maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches that estimate the migration rates and population sizes directly using coalescent theory can easily accommodate datasets that contain a population that has no data, a so-called 'ghost' population. This manipulation allows us to explore the effects of missing populations on the estimation of population sizes and migration rates between two specific populations. The biases of the inferred population parameters depend on the magnitude of the migration rate from the unknown populations. The effects on the population sizes are larger than the effects on the migration rates. The more immigrants from the unknown populations that are arriving in the sample populations the larger the estimated population sizes. Taking into account a ghost population improves or at least does not harm the estimation of population sizes. Estimates of the scaled migration rate M (migration rate per generation divided by the mutation rate per generation) are fairly robust as long as migration rates from the unknown populations are not huge. The inclusion of a ghost population does not improve the estimation of the migration rate M; when the migration rates are estimated as the number of immigrants Nm then a ghost population improves the estimates because of its effect on population size estimation. It seems that for 'real world' analyses one should carefully choose which populations to sample, but there is no need to sample every population in the neighbourhood of a population of interest.},

@article{Bennett:2010fk,
	Abstract = {Dengue is an emerging tropical disease infecting tens of millions of people annually. A febrile illness with potentially severe hemorrhagic manifestations, dengue is caused by mosquito-borne viruses (DENV-1 to -4) that are maintained in endemic transmission in large urban centers of the tropics with periodic epidemic cycles at 3- to 5-year intervals. Puerto Rico (PR), a major population center in the Caribbean, has experienced increasingly severe epidemics since multiple dengue serotypes were introduced beginning in the late 1970s. We document the phylodynamics of DENV-4 between 1981 and 1998, a period of dramatic ecological expansion during which evolutionary change also occurs. The timescale of viral evolution is sufficiently short that viral transmission dynamics can be elucidated from genetic diversity data. Specifically, by combining virus sequence data with confirmed case counts in PR over these two decades, we show that the pattern of cyclic epidemics is strongly correlated with coalescent estimates of effective population size that have been estimated from sampled virus sequences using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Thus, we show that the observed epidemiologic dynamics are correlated with similar fluctuations in diversity, including severe interepidemic reductions in genetic diversity compatible with population bottlenecks that may greatly impact DENV evolutionary dynamics. Mean effective population sizes based on genetic data appear to increase prior to isolation counts, suggesting a potential bias in the latter and justifying more active surveillance of DENV activity. Our analysis explicitly integrates epidemiologic and sequence data in a joint model that could be used to further explore transmission models of infectious disease.},

	Abstract = {Phylogenetic analysis 2013 the study of the genetic relatedness between {HIV} strains 2013 has recently been used in criminal prosecutions as evidence of responsibility for {HIV} transmission. In these trials, the expert opinion of virologists has been of critical importance. Phylogenetic analysis of {HIV} gene sequences is complex and its findings do not achieve the levels of certainty obtained with the forensic analysis of human {DNA.} Although two individuals may carry {HIV} strains that are closely related, these will not necessarily be unique to the two parties and could extend to other persons within the same transmission network. For forensic purposes, phylogenetic analysis should be conducted under strictly controlled conditions by laboratories with relevant expertise applying rigorous methods. It is vitally important to include the right controls, which should be epidemiologically and temporally relevant to the parties under investigation. Use of inappropriate controls can exaggerate any relatedness between the virus strains of the complainant and defendant as being strikingly unique. It will be often difficult to obtain the relevant controls. If convenient but less appropriate controls are used, interpretation of the findings should be tempered accordingly. Phylogenetic analysis cannot prove that {HIV} transmission occurred directly between two individuals. However, it can exonerate individuals by demonstrating that the defendant carries a virus strain unrelated to that of the complainant. Expert witnesses should acknowledge the limitations of the inferences that might be made and choose the correct language in both written and verbal testimony.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The spread of parasites is inherently a spatial process often embedded in physically complex landscapes. It is therefore not surprising that infectious disease researchers are increasingly taking a landscape genetics perspective to elucidate mechanisms underlying basic ecological processes driving infectious disease dynamics and to understand the linkage between spatially dependent population processes and the geographic distribution of genetic variation within both hosts and parasites. The increasing availability of genetic information on hosts and parasites when coupled to their ecological interactions can lead to insights for predicting patterns of disease emergence, spread and control. Here, we review research progress in this area based on four different motivations for the application of landscape genetics approaches: (i) assessing the spatial organization of genetic variation in parasites as a function of environmental variability, (ii) using host population genetic structure as a means to parameterize ecological dynamics that indirectly influence parasite populations, for example, gene flow and movement pathways across heterogeneous landscapes and the concurrent transport of infectious agents, (iii) elucidating the temporal and spatial scales of disease processes and (iv) reconstructing and understanding infectious disease invasion. Throughout this review, we emphasize that landscape genetic principles are relevant to infection dynamics across a range of scales from within host dynamics to global geographic patterns and that they can also be applied to unconventional `landscapes' such as heterogeneous contact networks underlying the spread of human and livestock diseases. We conclude by discussing some general considerations and problems for inferring epidemiological processes from genetic data and try to identify possible future directions and applications for this rapidly expanding field.},

	Abstract = {Naturally evolving proteins gradually accumulate mutations while continuing to fold to stable structures. This process of neutral evolution is an important mode of genetic change and forms the basis for the molecular clock. We present a mathematical theory that predicts the number of accumulated mutations, the index of dispersion, and the distribution of stabilities in an evolving protein population from knowledge of the stability effects (delta deltaG values) for single mutations. Our theory quantitatively describes how neutral evolution leads to marginally stable proteins and provides formulas for calculating how fluctuations in stability can overdisperse the molecular clock. It also shows that the structural influences on the rate of sequence evolution observed in earlier simulations can be calculated using just the single-mutation delta deltaG values. We consider both the case when the product of the population size and mutation rate is small and the case when this product is large, and show that in the latter case the proteins evolve excess mutational robustness that is manifested by extra stability and an increase in the rate of sequence evolution. All our theoretical predictions are confirmed by simulations with lattice proteins. Our work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding how protein biophysics shapes the process of evolution.},

Here we investigated long-term changes in virus load in patients treated with a combination of lamivudine and zidovudine to identify principal factors responsible for the observed 10- to 100-fold sustained suppression of virus load in vivo. Interestingly, most standard accounts of virus dynamics cannot explain a large sustained reduction without shifting the virus very close to extinction. The effect can be explained by taking into consideration either (i) the immune response against HIV, (ii) the killing of uninfected CD4 cells, or (iii) the differential efficacies of the drugs in different cell populations.},

	Abstract = {Selection is usually considered to be the dominant force controlling viral variation; the large population sizes suggest that deterministic population genetic models are appropriate. To investigate their validity for HIV, samples of env gene sequences were tested for departure from neutrality because of mutation-selection balance. None of the samples departed significantly when tested as nucleotide sequences. At the amino acid level, significantly elevated diversity was detected in two samples within, but not outside, the V3 loop. The effective population number has been estimated (using a phylogenetic method) to be close to 10(3). Estimates from nucleotide diversity are about 2-fold lower. The low value of the effective population number might arise from high variability in progeny number between infected cells, from the expansion in population number from a small inoculum as the virus is transmitted between hosts, or from variable selection at linked sites. These results suggest that the population genetics of HIV are best described by stochastic models.},

Each sample has been characterized by detailed molecular and phylogenetic {analyses.RESULTS:18} of the 25 samples were positive at {HIV-1} {PCR} amplification. Three samples showed a nucleotide divergence compatible with a {non-B} subtype classification. The phylogenetic analysis, performed on both {HIV-1} env and gag regions, confirms the molecular sub-typing prediction, given that 1 sample falls into the C subtype and 2 into the G subtype. The B subtype isolates show high levels of intra-subtype nucleotide divergence, compatible with a long-lasting epidemic and a progressive {HIV-1} molecular {diversification.CONCLUSION:The} Italian {HIV-1} epidemic is still mostly attributable to the B subtype, regardless the transmission route, which shows an increasing nucleotide heterogeneity. Heterosexual transmission and the interracial blending, however, are slowly introducing novel {HIV-1} subtypes. Therefore, a molecular monitoring is needed to follow the constant evolution of the {HIV-1} epidemic.},

	Abstract = {Although most of the important evolutionary events in the history of biology can only be studied via interspecific comparisons, it is challenging to apply the rich body of population genetic theory to the study of interspecific genetic variation. Probabilistic modeling of the substitution process would ideally be derived from first principles of population genetics, allowing a quantitative connection to be made between the parameters describing mutation, selection, drift, and the patterns of interspecific variation. There has been progress in reconciling population genetics and interspecific evolution for the case where mutation rates are sufficiently low, but when mutation rates are higher, reconciliation has been hampered due to complications from how the loss or fixation of new mutations can be influenced by linked nonneutral polymorphisms (i.e., the Hill-Robertson effect). To investigate the generation of interspecific genetic variation when concurrent fitness-affecting polymorphisms are common and the Hill-Robertson effect is thereby potentially strong, we used the Wright-Fisher model of population genetics to simulate very many generations of mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. This was done so that the chronological history of advantageous, deleterious, and neutral substitutions could be traced over time along the ancestral lineage. Our simulations show that the process by which a nonrecombining sequence changes over time can markedly deviate from the Markov assumption that is ubiquitous in molecular phylogenetics. In particular, we find tendencies for advantageous substitutions to be followed by deleterious ones and for deleterious substitutions to be followed by advantageous ones. Such non-Markovian patterns reflect the fact that the fate of the ancestral lineage depends not only on its current allelic state but also on gene copies not belonging to the ancestral lineage. Although our simulations describe nonrecombining sequences, we conclude by discussing how non-Markovian behavior of the ancestral lineage is plausible even when recombination rates are not low. As a result, we believe that increased attention needs to be devoted to the robustness of evolutionary inference procedures that rely upon the Markov assumption.},

	Abstract = {The biological theory of adaptive dynamics proposes a description of the long-term evolution of a structured asexual population. It is based on the assumptions of large population, rare mutations and small mutation steps, that lead to a deterministic ODE describing the evolution of the dominant type, called the "canonical equation of adaptive dynamics." Here, in order to include the effect of stochasticity (genetic drift), we consider self-regulated randomly fluctuating populations subject to mutation, so that the number of coexisting types may fluctuate. We apply a limit of rare mutations to these populations, while keeping the population size finite. This leads to a jump process, the so-called "trait substitution sequence," where evolution proceeds by successive invasions and fixations of mutant types. Then we apply a limit of small mutation steps (weak selection) to this jump process, that leads to a diffusion process that we call the "canonical diffusion of adaptive dynamics," in which genetic drift is combined with directional selection driven by the gradient of the fixation probability, also interpreted as an invasion fitness. Finally, we study in detail the particular case of multitype logistic branching populations and seek explicit formulae for the invasion fitness of a mutant deviating slightly from the resident type. In particular, second-order terms of the fixation probability are products of functions of the initial mutant frequency, times functions of the initial total population size, called the invasibility coefficients of the resident by increased fertility, defence, aggressiveness, isolation or survival.},

	Abstract = {The objectives of this paper to analyse, model and simulate the spread of an infectious disease by resorting to modern stochastic algorithms. The approach renders it possible to circumvent the simplifying assumption of linearity imposed in the majority of the past works on stochastic analysis of epidemic processes. Infectious diseases are often transmitted through contacts of those infected with those susceptible; hence the processes are inherently nonlinear. According to the classical model of Kermack and McKendrick, or the SIR model, three classes of populations are involved in two types of processes: conversion of susceptibles (S) to infectives (I) and conversion of infectives to removed (R). The master equations of the SIR process have been formulated through the probabilistic population balance around a particular state by considering the mutually exclusive events. The efficacy of the present methodology is mainly attributable to its ability to derive the governing equations for the means, variances and covariance of the random variables by the method of system-size expansion of the nonlinear master equations. Solving these equations simultaneously along with rates associated influenza epidemic data yields information concerning not only the means of the three populations but also the minimal uncertainties of these populations inherent in the epidemic. The stochastic pathways of the three different classes of populations during an epidemic, i.e. their means and the fluctuations around these means, have also been numerically simulated independently by the algorithm derived from the master equations, as well as by an event-driven Monte Carlo algorithm. The master equation and Monte Carlo algorithms have given rise to the identical results.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} In May, 1997, a 3-year-old boy in Hong Kong was admitted to the hospital and subsequently died from influenza pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, Reye's syndrome, multiorgan failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. An influenza A {H5N1} virus was isolated from a tracheal aspirate of the boy. Preceding this incident, avian influenza outbreaks of high mortality were reported from three chicken farms in Hong Kong, and the virus involved was also found to be of the H5 subtype. {METHODS:} We carried out an antigenic and molecular comparison of the influenza A {H5N1} virus isolated from the boy with one of the viruses isolated from outbreaks of avian influenza by haemagglutination-inhibition and neuraminidase-inhibition assays and nucleotide sequence analysis. {FINDINGS:} Differences were observed in the antigenic reactivities of the viruses by the haemagglutination-inhibition assay. However, nucleotide sequence analysis of all gene segments revealed that the human virus {A/Hong} Kong/156/97 was genetically closely related to the avian {A/chicken/Hong} Kong/258/97. {INTERPRETATION:} Although direct contact between the sick child and affected chickens has not been established, our results suggest transmission of the virus from infected chickens to the child without another intermediate mammalian host acting as a "mixing vessel". This event illustrates the importance of intensive global influenza surveillance.},

These results lead to a simple steady-state model in which infection, cell death, and cell replacement are in balance, and imply that the unique feature of HIV is the extraordinarily large number of replication cycles that occur during infection of a single individual. This turnover drives both the pathogenic process and (even more than mutation rate) the development of genetic variation. This variation includes the inevitable and, in principle, predictable accumulation of mutations such as those conferring resistance to antiviral drugs whose presence before therapy must be considered in the design of therapeutic strategies.},

The airline transportation network in particular shrinks the geographical space by reducing travel time between the world's most populated areas and defines the main channels along which emergent diseases will spread. In this paper, we investigate the role of the large-scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global propagation pattern of emerging diseases. We put forward a stochastic computational framework for the modeling of the global spreading of infectious diseases that takes advantage of the complete International Air Transport Association 2002 database complemented with census population data. The model is analyzed by using for the first time an information theory approach that allows the quantitative characterization of the heterogeneity level and the predictability of the spreading pattern in presence of stochastic fluctuations. In particular we are able to assess the reliability of numerical forecast with respect to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the disease transmission and travel flows. The epidemic pattern predictability is quantitatively determined and traced back to the occurrence of epidemic pathways defining a backbone of dominant connections for the disease spreading. The presented results provide a general computational framework for the analysis of containment policies and risk forecast of global epidemic outbreaks.},

	Abstract = {Estimating detailed transmission trees that reflect the relationships between infected individuals or populations during a disease outbreak often provides valuable insights into both the nature of disease transmission and the overall dynamics of the underlying epidemiological process. These trees may be based on epidemiological data that relate to the timing of infection and infectiousness, or genetic data that show the genetic relatedness of pathogens isolated from infected individuals. Genetic data are becoming increasingly important in the estimation of transmission trees of viral pathogens due to their inherently high mutation rate. Here, we propose a maximum-likelihood approach that allows epidemiological and genetic data to be combined within the same analysis to infer probable transmission trees. We apply this approach to data from 20 farms infected during the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, using complete viral genome sequences from each infected farm and information on when farms were first estimated to have developed clinical disease and when livestock on these farms were culled. Incorporating known infection links due to animal movement prior to imposition of the national movement ban results in the reduction of the number of trees from 41472 that are consistent with the genetic data to 1728, of which just 4 represent more than 95\% of the total likelihood calculated using a model that accounts for the epidemiological data. These trees differ in several ways from those constructed prior to the availability of genetic data.},

We describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling procedure that efficiently samples a variant of the generalized skyline plot, given sequence data, and combines these plots to generate a posterior distribution of effective population size through time. We apply the Bayesian skyline plot to simulated data sets and show that it correctly reconstructs demographic history under canonical scenarios. Finally, we compare the Bayesian skyline plot model to previous coalescent approaches by analyzing two real data sets (hepatitis C virus in Egypt and mitochondrial DNA of Beringian bison) that have been previously investigated using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison analysis, we detect a severe but previously unrecognized bottleneck, estimated to have occurred 10,000 radiocarbon years ago, which coincides with both the earliest undisputed record of large numbers of humans in Alaska and the megafaunal extinctions in North America at the beginning of the Holocene.},

	Abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolutionary analysis of molecular sequence variation is a statistical enterprise. This is reflected in the increased use of probabilistic models for phylogenetic inference, multiple sequence alignment, and molecular population genetics. Here we present BEAST: a fast, flexible software architecture for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences related by an evolutionary tree. A large number of popular stochastic models of sequence evolution are provided and tree-based models suitable for both within- and between-species sequence data are implemented. RESULTS: BEAST version 1.4.6 consists of 81000 lines of Java source code, 779 classes and 81 packages. It provides models for DNA and protein sequence evolution, highly parametric coalescent analysis, relaxed clock phylogenetics, non-contemporaneous sequence data, statistical alignment and a wide range of options for prior distributions. BEAST source code is object-oriented, modular in design and freely available at http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com/ under the GNU LGPL license. CONCLUSION: BEAST is a powerful and flexible evolutionary analysis package for molecular sequence variation. It also provides a resource for the further development of new models and statistical methods of evolutionary analysis.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many data summary statistics have been developed to detect departures from neutral expectations of evolutionary models. However questions about the neutrality of the evolution of genetic loci within natural populations remain difficult to assess. One critical cause of this difficulty is that most methods for testing neutrality make simplifying assumptions simultaneously about the mutational model and the population size model. Consequentially, rejecting the null hypothesis of neutrality under these methods could result from violations of either or both assumptions, making interpretation troublesome. RESULTS: Here we harness posterior predictive simulation to exploit summary statistics of both the data and model parameters to test the goodness-of-fit of standard models of evolution. We apply the method to test the selective neutrality of molecular evolution in non-recombining gene genealogies and we demonstrate the utility of our method on four real data sets, identifying significant departures of neutrality in human influenza A virus, even after controlling for variation in population size. CONCLUSION: Importantly, by employing a full model-based Bayesian analysis, our method separates the effects of demography from the effects of selection. The method also allows multiple summary statistics to be used in concert, thus potentially increasing sensitivity. Furthermore, our method remains useful in situations where analytical expectations and variances of summary statistics are not available. This aspect has great potential for the analysis of temporally spaced data, an expanding area previously ignored for limited availability of theory and methods.},

	Abstract = {Systems evolving under the influence of autocatalytic processes have been the subject of much study due to their appearance in a wide variety of contexts. Well known examples range from the simplest autocatalytic chemical reactions, biochemical models of ribozyme or prion replication, right up to the duplication of entire organisms in models of population dynamics. While the deterministic approach frequently taken to model such systems is adequate in the limit of large reactant numbers, the intrinsic fluctuations exert an important influence on the dynamics when the supply of reactants is limited. In particular, when combined with spontaneous degradation of the autocatalytic reactant population, such fluctuations can lead to the extinction of that population. In this paper, we study reversible autocatalytic processes of the form X + Y reversible arrow 2X in the limit that there exists a surplus of Y and in the presence of a spontaneous degradation process X -> Z. Through the use of the Poisson representation, we identify an exact analytical expression for the mean extinction time of the X population. We show that the exact result can be neatly approximated by an Arrhenius-like expression involving an effective activation energy separating a quasi-stationary state from the extinct state.},

These isolates represented 29 type A influenza virus hemagglutinin {(HA)} and neuraminidase {(NA)} subtype combinations, with up to 26\% of isolates showing evidence of mixed subtype infection. Through a phylogenetic analysis of the largest data set of {AIV} genomes compiled to date, we were able to document a remarkably high rate of genome reassortment, with no clear pattern of gene segment association and occasional inter-hemisphere gene segment migration and reassortment. From this, we propose that {AIV} in wild birds forms transient "genome constellations," continually reshuffled by reassortment, in contrast to the spread of a limited number of stable genome constellations that characterizes the evolution of mammalian-adapted influenza A viruses.},

	Abstract = {In 1979, a lineage of avian-like {H1N1} influenza A viruses emerged in European swine populations independently from the classical swine {H1N1} virus lineage that had circulated in pigs since the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918. To determine whether these two distinct lineages of swine-adapted {A/H1N1} viruses evolved from avian-like {A/H1N1} ancestors in similar ways, as might be expected given their common host species and origin, we compared patterns of nucleotide and amino acid change in whole genome sequences of both groups. An analysis of nucleotide compositional bias across all eight genomic segments for the two swine lineages showed a clear lineage-specific bias, although a segment-specific effect was also apparent. As such, there appears to be only a relatively weak host-specific selection pressure. Strikingly, despite each lineage evolving in the same species of host for decades, amino acid analysis revealed little evidence of either parallel or convergent changes. These findings suggest that although adaptation due to evolutionary lineages can be distinguished, there are functional and structural constraints on all gene segments and that the evolutionary trajectory of each lineage of swine {A/H1N1} virus has a strong historical contingency. Thus, in the context of emergence of an influenza A virus strain via a host switch event, it is difficult to predict what specific polygenic changes are needed for mammalian adaptation.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic diversity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) population within an individual is lost during transmission to a new host. The demography of transmission is an important determinant of evolutionary dynamics, particularly the relative impact of natural selection and genetic drift immediately following HIV-1 infection. Despite this, the magnitude of this population bottleneck is unclear. RESULTS: We use coalescent methods to quantify the bottleneck in a single case of homosexual transmission and find that over 99\% of the env and gag diversity present in the donor is lost. This was consistent with the diversity present at seroconversion in nine other horizontally infected individuals. Furthermore, we estimated viral diversity at birth in 27 infants infected through vertical transmission and found there to be no difference between the two modes of transmission. CONCLUSION: Assuming the bottleneck at transmission is selectively neutral, such a severe reduction in genetic diversity has important implications for adaptation in HIV-1, since beneficial mutations have a reduced chance of transmission.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) during chronic infection involves the rapid, continuous turnover of genetic diversity. However, the role of natural selection, relative to random genetic drift, in governing this process is unclear. We tested a stochastic model of genetic drift using partial envelope sequences sampled longitudinally in 28 infected children. In each case the Bayesian posterior (empirical) distribution of coalescent genealogies was estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Posterior predictive simulation was then used to generate a null distribution of genealogies assuming neutrality, with the null and empirical distributions compared using four genealogy-based summary statistics sensitive to nonneutral evolution. Because both null and empirical distributions were generated within a coalescent framework, we were able to explicitly account for the confounding influence of demography. From the distribution of corrected P-values across patients, we conclude that empirical genealogies are more asymmetric than expected if evolution is driven by mutation and genetic drift only, with an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms in the population. This indicates that although drift may still play an important role, natural selection has a strong influence on the evolution of HIV-1 envelope. A negative relationship between effective population size and substitution rate indicates that as the efficacy of selection increases, a smaller proportion of mutations approach fixation in the population. This suggests the presence of deleterious mutations. We therefore conclude that intrahost HIV-1 evolution in envelope is dominated by purifying selection against low-frequency deleterious mutations that do not reach fixation.},

	Abstract = {Using the structured serial coalescent with Bayesian {MCMC} and serial samples, we estimate population size when some demes are not sampled or are hidden, ie ghost demes. It is found that even with the presence of a ghost deme, accurate inference was possible if the parameters are estimated with the true model. However with an incorrect model, estimates were biased and can be positively misleading. We extend these results to the case where there are sequences from the ghost at the last time sample. This case can arise in {HIV} patients, when some tissue samples and viral sequences only become available after death. When some sequences from the ghost deme are available at the last sampling time, estimation bias is reduced and accurate estimation of parameters associated with the ghost deme is possible despite sampling bias. Migration rates for this case are also shown to be good estimates when migration values are low.},

	Abstract = {Summary The application of maximum likelihood techniques to the estimation of evolutionary trees from nucleic acid sequence data is discussed. A computationally feasible method for finding such maximum likelihood estimates is developed, and a computer program is available. This method has advantages over the traditional parsimony algorithms, which can give misleading results if rates of evolution differ in different lineages. It also allows the testing of hypotheses about the constancy of evolutionary rates by likelihood ratio tests, and gives rough indication of the error of the estimate of the tree.},

	Abstract = {A computer simulation study has been made of the accuracy of estimates of Theta = 4Nemu from a sample from a single isolated population of finite size. The accuracies turn out to be well predicted by a formula developed by Fu and Li, who used optimistic assumptions. Their formulas are restated in terms of accuracy, defined here as the reciprocal of the squared coefficient of variation. This should be proportional to sample size when the entities sampled provide independent information. Using these formulas for accuracy, the sampling strategy for estimation of Theta can be investigated. Two models for cost have been used, a cost-per-base model and a cost-per-read model. The former would lead us to prefer to have a very large number of loci, each one base long. The latter, which is more realistic, causes us to prefer to have one read per locus and an optimum sample size which declines as costs of sampling organisms increase. For realistic values, the optimum sample size is 8 or fewer individuals. This is quite close to the results obtained by Pluzhnikov and Donnelly for a cost-per-base model, evaluating other estimators of Theta. It can be understood by considering that the resources spent collecting larger samples prevent us from considering more loci. An examination of the efficiency of Watterson's estimator of Theta was also made, and it was found to be reasonably efficient when the number of mutants per generation in the sequence in the whole population is less than 2.5.},

	Abstract = {In pandemic and epidemic forms, influenza causes substantial, sometimes catastrophic, morbidity and mortality. Intense selection from the host immune system drives antigenic change in influenza A and B, resulting in continuous replacement of circulating strains with new variants able to re-infect hosts immune to earlier types. This 'antigenic drift' often requires a new vaccine to be formulated before each annual epidemic. However, given the high transmissibility and mutation rate of influenza, the constancy of genetic diversity within lineages over time is paradoxical. Another enigma is the replacement of existing strains during a global pandemic caused by 'antigenic shift'--the introduction of a new avian influenza A subtype into the human population. Here we explore ecological and immunological factors underlying these patterns using a mathematical model capturing both realistic epidemiological dynamics and viral evolution at the sequence level. By matching model output to phylogenetic patterns seen in sequence data collected through global surveillance, we find that short-lived strain-transcending immunity is essential to restrict viral diversity in the host population and thus to explain key aspects of drift and shift dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses are now endemic in avian populations in Southeast Asia, and human cases continue to accumulate. Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility. Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient for elimination. Policy effectiveness depends critically on how quickly clinical cases are diagnosed and the speed with which antiviral drugs can be distributed.},

	Abstract = {Double-stranded (ds) {DNA} viruses are often described as evolving through long-term codivergent associations with their hosts, a pattern that is expected to be associated with low rates of nucleotide substitution. However, the hypothesis of codivergence between {dsDNA} viruses and their hosts has rarely been rigorously tested, even though the vast majority of nucleotide substitution rate estimates for {dsDNA} viruses are based upon this assumption. It is therefore important to estimate the evolutionary rates of {dsDNA} viruses independent of the assumption of host-virus codivergence. Here, we explore the use of temporally-structured sequence data within a Bayesian framework to estimate the evolutionary rates for seven human {dsDNA} viruses, including variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) and herpes simplex virus-1. Our analyses reveal that while the variola virus genome is likely to evolve at a rate of approximately 1 x 10-5 substitutions/site/year, and hence approaching that of many {RNA} viruses, the evolutionary rates of many other {dsDNA} viruses remain problematic to estimate. Synthetic data sets were constructed to inform our interpretation of the substitution rates estimated for these {dsDNA} viruses and the analysis of these demonstrated that given a sequence data set of appropriate length and sampling depth, it is possible to use time-structured analyses to estimate the substitution rates of many {dsDNA} viruses independently from the assumption of host-virus codivergence. Finally, the discovery that some {dsDNA} viruses may evolve at rates approaching those of {RNA} viruses has important implications for our understanding of the long-term evolutionary history and emergence potential of this major group of viruses.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the HA1 domain of 254 human influenza A(H3N2) virus genes for clues that might help identify characteristics of hemagglutinins (HAs) of circulating strains that are predictive of that strain's epidemic potential. Our preliminary findings include the following. (i) The most parsimonious tree found requires 1,260 substitutions of which 712 are silent and 548 are replacement substitutions. (ii) The HA1 portion of the HA gene is evolving at a rate of 5.7 nucleotide substitutions/year or 5.7 x 10(-3) substitutions/site per year. (iii) The replacement substitutions are distributed randomly across the three positions of the codon when allowance is made for the number of ways each codon can change the encoded amino acid. (iv) The replacement substitutions are not distributed randomly over the branches of the tree, there being 2.2 times more changes per tip branch than for non-tip branches. This result is independent of how the virus was amplified (egg grown or kidney cell grown) prior to sequencing or if sequencing was carried out directly on the original clinical specimen by PCR. (v) These excess changes on the tip branches are probably the result of a bias in the choice of strains to sequence and the detection of deleterious mutations that had not yet been removed by negative selection. (vi) There are six hypervariable codons accumulating replacement substitutions at an average rate that is 7.2 times that of the other varied codons. (vii) The number of variable codons in the trunk branches (the winners of the competitive race against the immune system) is 47 +/- 5, significantly fewer than in the twigs (90 +/- 7), which in turn is significantly fewer variable codons than in tip branches (175 +/- 8). (viii) A minimum of one of every 12 branches has nodes at opposite ends representing viruses that reside on different continents. This is, however, no more than would be expected if one were to randomly reassign the continent of origin of the isolates. (ix) Of 99 codons with at least four mutations, 31 have ratios of non-silent to silent changes with probabilities less than 0.05 of occurring by chance, and 14 of those have probabilities <0.005. These observations strongly support positive Darwinian selection. We suggest that the small number of variable positions along the successful trunk lineage, together with knowledge of the codons that have shown positive selection, may provide clues that permit an improved prediction of which strains will cause epidemics and therefore should be used for vaccine production.},

We present a codon-based model that attempts to include these effects by allowing the position-specific substitution process to change in conjunction with a host change event. Following maximum-likelihood parameter estimation, we employ an empirical Bayesian procedure to identify candidate sites potentially involved in host-specific adaptation. We discuss the applicability of the model to the more general problem of ascertaining whether the selective regime differs in two groups of related organisms.

	Abstract = {A novel influenza A (H1N1) virus has spread rapidly across the globe. Judging its pandemic potential is difficult with limited data, but nevertheless essential to inform appropriate health responses. By analyzing the outbreak in Mexico, early data on international spread, and viral genetic diversity, we make an early assessment of transmissibility and severity. Our estimates suggest that 23,000 (range 6000 to 32,000) individuals had been infected in Mexico by late April, giving an estimated case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.4\% (range: 0.3 to 1.8\%) based on confirmed and suspected deaths reported to that time. In a community outbreak in the small community of La Gloria, Veracruz, no deaths were attributed to infection, giving an upper 95\% bound on CFR of 0.6\%. Thus, although substantial uncertainty remains, clinical severity appears less than that seen in the 1918 influenza pandemic but comparable with that seen in the 1957 pandemic. Clinical attack rates in children in La Gloria were twice that in adults (<15 years of age: 61\%; >/=15 years: 29\%). Three different epidemiological analyses gave basic reproduction number (R0) estimates in the range of 1.4 to 1.6, whereas a genetic analysis gave a central estimate of 1.2. This range of values is consistent with 14 to 73 generations of human-to-human transmission having occurred in Mexico to late April. Transmissibility is therefore substantially higher than that of seasonal flu, and comparable with lower estimates of R0 obtained from previous influenza pandemics.},

This approach has been used to study the dynamics of many different viruses, and has demonstrated a wide variety of patterns, which have been interpreted in the context of changes over time in the 'effective number of infections', a quantity proportional to the number of infected individuals. However, for infectious diseases, the rate of coalescence is driven primarily by new transmissions i.e. the incidence, and only indirectly by the number of infected individuals through sampling effects. Using commonly used epidemiological models, we show that the coalescence rate may indeed reflect the number of infected individuals during the initial phase of exponential growth when time is scaled by infectivity, but in general, a single change in time scale cannot be used to estimate the number of infected individuals. This has important implications when integrating phylogenetic data in the context of other epidemiological data.},

	Abstract = {The mean fitness of a population, often equal to its growth rate, measures its level of adaptation to particular environmental conditions. A better understanding of the evolution of mean fitness could thus provide a natural link between evolution and demography. Yet, after the seminal work of Fisher and its renowned "fundamental theorem of natural selection," the dynamics of mean fitness has attracted little attention, and mostly from theoretical population geneticists. Here we analyze the dynamics of mean fitness in the context of host-parasite interactions. We illustrate the potential relevance of this analysis under different scenarios ranging from a simple situation in which a parasite evolves in a homogeneous host population to a more complex one with host-parasite coevolution. In each case, we contrast the effects of natural selection, recurrent mutations, and the change of the biotic environment, on the dynamics of adaptation. Decoupling these three components helps elucidate the interplay between evolutionary and ecological dynamics. In particular, it offers new perspectives on situations leading to evolutionary suicide. As mean fitness is an easily measurable quantity in microbial systems, this analysis provides new ways to track the dynamics of adaptation in experimental evolution and coevolution studies.},

The process is conditioned to have n extant species today, we look at the tree distribution of the reconstructed trees--i.e. the trees without the extinct species. Whereas the tree shape distribution is well-known and actually the same as under the pure birth process, no analytic results for the speciation times were known. We provide the distribution for the speciation times and calculate the expectations analytically. This characterizes the reconstructed trees completely. We will show how the results can be used to date phylogenies.},

	Abstract = {The swine-origin influenza A {(H1N1)} virus that appeared in 2009 and was first found in human beings in Mexico, is a reassortant with at least three parents. Six of the genes are closest in sequence to those of {H1N2} 'triple-reassortant' influenza viruses isolated from pigs in North America around 1999-2000. Its other two genes are from different Eurasian 'avian-like' viruses of pigs; the {NA} gene is closest to {H1N1} viruses isolated in Europe in 1991-1993, and the {MP} gene is closest to {H3N2} viruses isolated in Asia in 1999-2000. The sequences of these genes do not directly reveal the immediate source of the virus as the closest were from isolates collected more than a decade before the human pandemic started. The three parents of the virus may have been assembled in one place by natural means, such as by migrating birds, however the consistent link with pig viruses suggests that human activity was involved. We discuss a published suggestion that unsampled pig herds, the intercontinental live pig trade, together with porous quarantine barriers, generated the reassortant. We contrast that suggestion with the possibility that laboratory errors involving the sharing of virus isolates and cultured cells, or perhaps vaccine production, may have been involved. Gene sequences from isolates that bridge the time and phylogenetic gap between the new virus and its parents will distinguish between these possibilities, and we suggest where they should be sought. It is important that the source of the new virus be found if we wish to avoid future pandemics rather than just trying to minimize the consequences after they have emerged. Influenza virus is a very significant zoonotic pathogen. Public confidence in influenza research, and the agribusinesses that are based on influenza's many hosts, has been eroded by several recent events involving the virus. Measures that might restore confidence include establishing a unified international administrative framework coordinating surveillance, research and commercial work with this virus, and maintaining a registry of all influenza isolates.},

The methods, which are based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, are developed in the context of epidemic models. Their use is illustrated for the particular case where only susceptible, infective, and removed states are represented using simulated realizations of the process. By comparing estimated likelihoods with theoretical forms, in cases where these can be derived, or with the known model parameters, we show that the methods can be used to provide meaningful estimates of parameters and parameter uncertainty. Potential applications of the techniques are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {With ongoing generation of viral genetic diversity and increasing levels of migration, the global human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) epidemic is becoming increasingly heterogeneous. In this study, we investigate the epidemiological characteristics of 5,675 HIV-1 pol gene sequences sampled from distinct infections in the United Kingdom. These sequences were phylogenetically analyzed in conjunction with 976 complete-genome and 3,201 pol gene reference sequences sampled globally and representing the broad range of HIV-1 genetic diversity, allowing us to estimate the probable geographic origins of the various strains present in the United Kingdom. A statistical analysis of phylogenetic clustering in this data set identified several independent transmission chains within the United Kingdom involving recently introduced strains and indicated that strains more commonly associated with infections acquired heterosexually in East Africa are spreading among men who have sex with men. Coalescent approaches were also used and indicated that the transmission chains that we identify originated in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Similar changes in the epidemiological structuring of HIV epidemics are likely to be taking in place in other industrialized nations with large immigrant populations. The framework implemented here takes advantage of the vast amount of routinely generated HIV-1 sequence data and can provide epidemiological insights not readily obtainable through standard surveillance methods.},

@article{Gilbert:2007qa,
	Abstract = {HIV-1 group M subtype B was the first HIV discovered and is the predominant variant of AIDS virus in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. However, the circumstances of its origin and emergence remain unresolved. Here we propose a geographic sequence and time line for the origin of subtype B and the emergence of pandemic HIV/AIDS out of Africa. Using HIV-1 gene sequences recovered from archival samples from some of the earliest known Haitian AIDS patients, we find that subtype B likely moved from Africa to Haiti in or around 1966 (1962-1970) and then spread there for some years before successfully dispersing elsewhere. A "pandemic" clade, encompassing the vast majority of non-Haitian subtype B infections in the United States and elsewhere around the world, subsequently emerged after a single migration of the virus out of Haiti in or around 1969 (1966-1972). Haiti appears to have the oldest HIV/AIDS epidemic outside sub-Saharan Africa and the most genetically diverse subtype B epidemic, which might present challenges for HIV-1 vaccine design and testing. The emergence of the pandemic variant of subtype B was an important turning point in the history of AIDS, but its spread was likely driven by ecological rather than evolutionary factors. Our results suggest that HIV-1 circulated cryptically in the United States for approximately 12 years before the recognition of AIDS in 1981.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a model for assessing the levels and patterns of genetic diversity in pathogen populations, whose epidemiology follows a susceptible-infected-recovered model (SIR). We model the population of pathogens as a metapopulation composed of subpopulations (infected hosts), where pathogens replicate and mutate. Hosts transmit pathogens to uninfected hosts. We show that the level of pathogen variation is well predicted by analytical expressions, such that pathogen neutral molecular variation is bounded by the level of infection and increases with the duration of infection. We then introduce selection in the model and study the invasion probability of a new pathogenic strain whose fitness (R(0)(1+s)) is higher than the fitness of the resident strain (R(0)). We show that this invasion probability is given by the relative increment in R(0) of the new pathogen (s). By analyzing the patterns of genetic diversity in this framework, we identify the molecular signatures during the replacement and compare these with those observed in sequences of influenza A.},

	Abstract = {Avian influenza A viruses from Asia are recognized as the source of genes that reassorted with human viral genes to generate the Asian/57 {(H2N2)} and Hong Kong/68 {(H3N2)} pandemic strains earlier in this century. Here we report the genetic analysis of avian influenza A {H1N1} viruses recently isolated from pigs in southern China, a host suspected to generate new pandemic strains through gene reassortment events. Each of the eight gene segments was of avian origin. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these genes form an Asian sublineage of the Eurasian avian lineage, suggesting that these viruses are an independent introduction into pigs in Asia. The presence of avian influenza viruses in pigs in China places them in an optimal position for transmission to humans and may serve as an early warning of the emergence of the next human influenza virus pandemic.},

@article{Guindon:2004ys,
	Abstract = {The unambiguous footprint of positive Darwinian selection in protein-coding DNA sequences is revealed by an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions over synonymous substitutions compared with the neutral expectation. Methods for analyzing the patterns of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions usually rely on stochastic models in which the selection regime may vary across the sequence but remains constant across lineages for any amino acid position. Despite some work that has relaxed the constraint that selection patterns remain constant over time, no model provides a strong statistical framework to deal with switches between selection processes at individual sites during the course of evolution. This paper describes an approach that allows the site-specific selection process to vary along lineages of a phylogenetic tree. The parameters of the switching model of codon substitution are estimated by using maximum likelihood. The analysis of eight HIV-1 env homologous sequence data sets shows that this model provides a significantly better fit to the data than one that does not take into account switches between selection patterns in the phylogeny at individual sites. We also provide strong evidence that the strength and the frequency of occurrence of selection might not be estimated accurately when the site-specific variation of selection regimes is ignored.},

	Abstract = {The ratio of the effective population size to adult (or census) population size (Ne/N) is an indicator of the extent of genetic variation expected in a population. It has been suggested that this ratio may be quite low for highly fecund species in which there is a sweepstakes-like chance of reproductive success, known as the Hedgecock effect. Here I show theoretically how the ratio may be quite small when there are only a few successful breeders (Nb) and that in this case, the Ne/N ratio is approximately Nb/N. In other words, high variance in reproductive success within a generation can result in a very low effective population size in an organism with large numbers of adults and consequently a very low Ne/N ratio. This finding appears robust when there is a large proportion of families with exactly two progeny or when there is random variation in progeny numbers among these families.},

	Abstract = {Viruses, especially those with RNA genomes, represent ideal organisms to study the dynamics of microevolutionary change. In particular, their rapid rate of nucleotide substitution means that the epidemiological processes that shape their diversity act on the same time-scale as mutations are fixed in viral populations. Consequently, the branching structure of virus phylogenies provides a unique insight into spatial and temporal dynamics. Herein, I describe the key processes in virus phylogeography. These are generally associated with the relative rates of dispersal among populations and virus-host codivergence (vicariance), and the division between acute (short-term) and persistent (long-term) infections. These processes will be illustrated by important human viruses - HIV, dengue, rabies, polyomavirus JC and human papillomavirus - which display varying spatial and temporal structures and virus-host relationships. Key research questions for the future will also be established.},

	Abstract = {Despite the wealth of data describing the ecological factors that underpin viral emergence, little is known about the evolutionary processes that allow viruses to jump species barriers and establish productive infections in new hosts. Understanding the evolutionary basis to virus emergence is therefore a key research goal and many of the debates in this area can be considered within the rigorous theoretical framework established by evolutionary genetics. In particular, the respective roles played by natural selection and genetic drift in shaping genetic diversity are also of fundamental importance for understanding the nature of viral emergence. Herein, we discuss whether there are evolutionary rules to viral emergence, and especially whether certain types of virus, or those that infect a particular type of host species, are more likely to emerge than others. We stress the complex interplay between rates of viral evolution and the ability to recognize cell receptors from phylogenetically divergent host species. We also emphasize the current lack of convincing data as to whether viral emergence requires adaptation to the new host species during the early stages of infection, or whether it is largely a chance process involving the transmission of a viral strain with the necessary genetic characteristics.},

Using various Bayesian molecular-clock models, interspecies transfer of this SLCoV lineage from bats to the amplifying host (e.g., civets) was estimated to have happened a median of 4.08 years before the SARS outbreak. Based on this relatively short window period, we speculate that this uncharacterized SLCoV lineage may contain the direct ancestor of SCoV. This study sheds light on the possible host bat species of the direct ancestor of SCoV, providing valuable information on the scope and focus of surveillance for the origin of SCoV.},

	Abstract = {A common problem in molecular phylogenetics is choosing a model of {DNA} substitution that does a good job of explaining the {DNA} sequence alignment without introducing superfluous parameters. A number of methods have been used to choose among a small set of candidate substitution models, such as the likelihood ratio test, the Akaike Information Criterion {(AIC),} the Bayesian Information Criterion {(BIC),} and Bayes factors. Current implementations of any of these criteria suffer from the limitation that only a small set of models are examined, or that the test does not allow easy comparison of non-nested models. In this article, we expand the pool of candidate substitution models to include all possible time-reversible models. This set includes seven models that have already been described. We show how Bayes factors can be calculated for these models using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, and apply the method to 16 {DNA} sequence alignments. For each data set, we compare the model with the best Bayes factor to the best models chosen using {AIC} and {BIC.} We find that the best model under any of these criteria is not necessarily the most complicated one; models with an intermediate number of substitution types typically do best. Moreover, almost all of the models that are chosen as best do not constrain a transition rate to be the same as a transversion rate, suggesting that it is the transition/transversion rate bias that plays the largest role in determining which models are selected. Importantly, the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm described here allows estimation of phylogeny (and other phylogenetic model parameters) to be performed while accounting for uncertainty in the model of {DNA} substitution.},

	Abstract = {The heterosexual risk group has become the largest HIV infected group in the United Kingdom during the last 10 years, but little is known of the network structure and dynamics of viral transmission in this group. The overwhelming majority of UK heterosexual infections are of non-B HIV subtypes, indicating viruses originating among immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa. The high rate of HIV evolution, combined with the availability of a very high density sample of viral sequences from routine clinical care has allowed the phylodynamics of the epidemic to be investigated for the first time. Sequences of the viral protease and partial reverse transcriptase coding regions from 11,071 patients infected with HIV of non-B subtypes were studied. Of these, 2774 were closely linked to at least one other sequence by nucleotide distance. Including the closest sequences from the global HIV database identified 296 individuals that were in UK-based groups of 3 or more individuals. There were a total of 8 UK-based clusters of 10 or more, comprising 143/2774 (5\%) individuals, much lower than the figure of 25\% obtained earlier for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sample dates were incorporated into relaxed clock phylogenetic analyses to estimate the dates of internal nodes. From the resulting time-resolved phylogenies, the internode lengths, used as estimates of maximum transmission intervals, had a median of 27 months overall, over twice as long as obtained for MSM (14 months), with only 2\% of transmissions occurring in the first 6 months after infection. This phylodynamic analysis of non-B subtype HIV sequences representing over 40\% of the estimated UK HIV-infected heterosexual population has revealed heterosexual HIV transmission in the UK is clustered, but on average in smaller groups and is transmitted with slower dynamics than among MSM. More effective intervention to restrict the epidemic may therefore be feasible, given effective diagnosis programmes.},

	Annote = {The study of rates of nucleotide substitution in {RNA} viruses is central to our understanding of their evolution. Herein we report a comprehensive analysis of substitution rates in 50 {RNA} viruses using a recently developed maximum likelihood phylogenetic method. This analysis revealed a significant relationship between genetic divergence and isolation time for an extensive array of {RNA} viruses, although more rate variation was usually present among lineages than would be expected under the constraints of a molecular clock. Despite the lack of a molecular clock, the range of statistically significant variation in overall substitution rates was surprisingly narrow for those viruses where a significant relationship between genetic divergence and time was found, as was the case when synonymous sites were considered alone, where the molecular clock was rejected less frequently. An analysis of the ecological and genetic factors that might explain this rate variation revealed some evidence of significantly lower substitution rates in vector-borne viruses, as well as a weak correlation between rate and genome length. Finally, a simulation study revealed that our maximum likelihood estimates of substitution rates are valid, even if the molecular clock is rejected, provided that sufficiently large data sets are analyzed.},

@article{Jewell:2009fk,
	Abstract = {Mathematical simulation modelling of epidemic processes has recently become a popular tool in guiding policy decisions for potential disease outbreaks. Such models all rely on various parameters in order to specify quantities such as transmission and detection rates. However, the values of these parameters are peculiar to an individual outbreak, and estimating them in advance of an epidemic has been the major difficulty in the predictive credibility of such approaches. The obstruction to classical approaches in estimating model parameters has been that of missing data: (i) an infected individual is only detected after the onset of clinical signs, we never observe the time of infection directly; (ii) if we wish to make inference on an epidemic while it is in progress (in order to predict how it might unfold in the future), we must take into account the fact that there may be individuals who are infected but not yet detected. In this paper we apply a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to a combined spatial and contact network model constructed in a Bayesian context to provide a real-time risk prediction during an epidemic. Using the example of a potential Avian H5N1 epidemic in the UK poultry industry, we demonstrate how such a technique can be used to give real-time predictions of quantities such as the probability of individual poultry holdings becoming infected, the risk that individual holdings pose to the population if they become infected, and the number and whereabouts of infected, but not yet detected, holdings. Since the methodology generalises easily to many epidemic situations, we anticipate its use as a real-time decision-support tool for targetting disease control to critical transmission processes, and for monitoring the efficacy of current control policy.},

	Abstract = {The precise identification of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) responsible for productive clinical infection could be instrumental in elucidating the molecular basis of HIV-1 transmission and in designing effective vaccines. Here, we developed a mathematical model of random viral evolution and, together with phylogenetic tree construction, used it to analyze 3,449 complete env sequences derived by single genome amplification from 102 subjects with acute HIV-1 (clade B) infection. Viral env genes evolving from individual transmitted or founder viruses generally exhibited a Poisson distribution of mutations and star-like phylogeny, which coalesced to an inferred consensus sequence at or near the estimated time of virus transmission. Overall, 78 of 102 subjects had evidence of productive clinical infection by a single virus, and 24 others had evidence of productive clinical infection by a minimum of two to five viruses. Phenotypic analysis of transmitted or early founder Envs revealed a consistent pattern of CCR5 dependence, masking of coreceptor binding regions, and equivalent or modestly enhanced resistance to the fusion inhibitor T1249 and broadly neutralizing antibodies compared with Envs from chronically infected subjects. Low multiplicity infection and limited viral evolution preceding peak viremia suggest a finite window of potential vulnerability of HIV-1 to vaccine-elicited immune responses, although phenotypic properties of transmitted Envs pose a formidable defense.},

	Abstract = {This article develops a theoretical framework to link dynamical and population genetic models of persistent viral infection. This linkage is useful because, while the dynamical and population genetic theories have developed independently, the biological processes they describe are completely interrelated. Parameters of the dynamical models are important determinants of evolutionary processes such as natural selection and genetic drift. We develop analytical methods, based on coupled differential equations and Markov chain theory, to predict the accumulation of genetic diversity within the viral population as a function of dynamical parameters. These methods are first applied to the standard model of viral dynamics and then generalized to consider the infection of multiple host cell types by the viral population. Each cell type is characterized by specific parameter values. Inclusion of multiple cell types increases the likelihood of persistent infection and can increase the amount of genetic diversity within the viral population. However, the overall rate of gene sequence evolution may actually be reduced.},

@article{Keogh:2009fk,
	Abstract = {Founder populations in reintroduction programmes can experience a genetic bottleneck simply because of their small size. The influence of reproductive skew brought on by polygynous or polyandrous mating systems in these populations can exacerbate already difficult conservation genetic problems, such as inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential. Without an understanding of reproductive skew in a target species, and the effect it can have on genetic diversity retained over generations, long-term conservation goals will be compromised. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Miller et al. (2009a) test how founder group size and variance in male reproductive success influence the maintenance of genetic diversity following reintroduction on a long-term scale. They evaluated genetic diversity in two wild populations of the iconic New Zealand tuatara (Fig. 1), which differ greatly in population size and genetic diversity, and compared this to genetic diversity in multiple founder populations sourced from both populations. Population viability analysis on the maintenance of genetic diversity over 400 years (10 generations) demonstrated that while the loss of heterozygosity was low when compared with both source populations (1-14\%), the greater the male reproductive skew, the greater the predicted losses of genetic diversity. Importantly however, the loss of genetic diversity was ameliorated after population size exceeded 250 animals, regardless of the level of reproductive skew. This study demonstrates that highly informed conservation decisions could be made when you build on a solid foundation of demographic, natural history and behavioural ecology data. These data, when informed by modern population and genetic analysis, mean that fundamental applied conservation questions (how many animals should make up a founder population?) can be answered accurately and with an eye to the long-term consequences of management decisions.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of rapidly evolving pathogens is one of the most challenging problems facing disease ecologists today. To date, many mathematical and individual-based models have provided key insights into the factors that may regulate these dynamics. However, in many of these models, abstractions have been made to the simulated sequences that limit an effective interface with empirical data. This is especially the case for rapidly evolving viruses in which de novo mutations result in antigenically novel variants. With this focus, we present a simple two-tiered 'phylodynamic' model whose purpose is to simulate, along with case data, sequence data that will allow for a more quantitative interface with observed sequence data. The model differs from previous approaches in that it separates the simulation of the epidemiological dynamics (tier 1) from the molecular evolution of the virus's dominant antigenic protein (tier 2). This separation of phenotypic dynamics from genetic dynamics results in a modular model that is computationally simpler and allows sequences to be simulated with specifications such as sequence length, nucleotide composition and molecular constraints. To illustrate its use, we apply the model to influenza A (H3N2) dynamics in humans, influenza B dynamics in humans and influenza A (H3N8) dynamics in equine hosts. In all three of these illustrative examples, we show that the model can simulate sequences that are quantitatively similar in pattern to those empirically observed. Future work should focus on statistical estimation of model parameters for these examples as well as the possibility of applying this model, or variants thereof, to other host-virus systems.},

Using a comprehensive full-length envelope sequence alignment, we estimated the date of the last common ancestor of the main group of HIV-1 to be 1931 (1915-41). Analysis of a gag gene alignment, subregions of envelope including additional sequences, and a method that relaxed the assumption of a strict molecular clock also supported these results.},

The largely discrepant estimates, the complexity of the concept of the effective population size and the resulting uncertainty about the underlying assumptions make the interpretation of these estimates difficult. Here, we explain the concept and critically assess the current estimates. We discuss the biologically relevant factors that affect the estimate and use of the effective population size. We argue that these factors lead to an underestimation of the effective population size and, thus, to an overestimation of the strength of stochastic effects in HIV-1 evolution.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequence data from resistance testing offer unique opportunities to characterize the structure of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection epidemics. METHODS: We analyzed a representative set of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) subtype B pol sequences from 5700 patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. We pooled these sequences with the same number of sequences from foreign epidemics, inferred a phylogeny, and identified Swiss transmission clusters as clades having a minimal size of 10 and containing >or=80\% Swiss sequences. RESULTS: More than one-half of Swiss patients were included within 60 transmission clusters. Most transmission clusters were significantly dominated by specific transmission routes, which were used to identify the following patient groups: men having sex with men (MSM) (38 transmission clusters; average cluster size, 29 patients) or patients acquiring HIV through heterosexual contact (HETs) and injection drug users (IDUs) (12 transmission clusters; average cluster size, 144 patients). Interestingly, there were no transmission clusters dominated by sequences from HETs only. Although 44\% of all HETs who were infected between 1983 and 1986 clustered with injection drug users, this percentage decreased to 18\% for 2003-2006 (P<.001), indicating a diminishing role of injection drug users in transmission among HETs over time. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests (1) the absence of a self-sustaining epidemic of HIV-1 subtype B in HETs in Switzerland and (2) a temporally decreasing clustering of HIV infections in HETs and IDUs.},

	Abstract = {We describe a mathematical model and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of viral evolution during acute infection. We consider both synchronous and asynchronous processes of viral infection of new target cells. The model enables an assessment of the expected sequence diversity in new HIV-1 infections originating from a single transmitted viral strain, estimation of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the transmitted viral lineage, and estimation of the time to coalesce back to the MRCA. We also calculate the probability of the MRCA being the transmitted virus or an evolved variant. Excluding insertions and deletions, we assume HIV-1 evolves by base substitution without selection pressure during the earliest phase of HIV-1 infection prior to the immune response. Unlike phylogenetic methods that follow a lineage backwards to coalescence, we compare the observed data to a model of the diversification of a viral population forward in time. To illustrate the application of these methods, we provide detailed comparisons of the model and simulations results to 306 envelope sequences obtained from eight newly infected subjects at a single time point. The data from 68 patients were in good agreement with model predictions, and hence compatible with a single-strain infection evolving under no selection pressure. The diversity of the samples from the other two patients was too great to be explained by the model, suggesting multiple HIV-1-strains were transmitted. The model can also be applied to longitudinal patient data to estimate within-host viral evolutionary parameters.},

	Abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses are increasingly used in attempts to clarify transmission patterns of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 {(HIV-1),} but there is a continuing discussion about their validity because convergent evolution and transmission of minor {HIV} variants may obscure epidemiological patterns. Here we have studied a unique {HIV-1} transmission cluster consisting of nine infected individuals, for whom the time and direction of each virus transmission was exactly known. Most of the transmissions occurred between 1981 and 1983, and a total of 13 blood samples were obtained approximately 2-12 years later. The p17 gag and env V3 regions of the {HIV-1} genome were directly sequenced from uncultured lymphocytes. A true phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the knowledge about when the transmissions had occurred and when the samples were obtained. This complex, known {HIV-1} transmission history was compared with reconstructed molecular trees, which were calculated from the {DNA} sequences by several commonly used phylogenetic inference methods {[Fitch-Margoliash,} neighbor-joining, minimum-evolution, maximum-likelihood, maximum-parsimony, unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages {(UPGMA),} and a {Fitch-Margoliash} method assuming a molecular clock {(KITSCH)].} A majority of the reconstructed trees were good estimates of the true phylogeny; 12 of 13 taxa were correctly positioned in the most accurate trees. The choice of gene fragment was found to be more important than the choice of phylogenetic method and substitution model. However, methods that are sensitive to unequal rates of change performed more poorly (such as {UPGMA} and {KITSCH,} which assume a constant molecular clock). The rapidly evolving V3 fragment gave better reconstructions than p17, but a combined data set of both p17 and V3 performed best. The accuracy of the phylogenetic methods justifies their use in {HIV-1} research and argues against convergent evolution and selective transmission of certain virus variants.},

	Abstract = {In this study we date the introduction of {HIV-2} into the human population and estimate the epidemic history of {HIV-2} subtype A in {Guinea-Bissau,} the putative geographic origin of {HIV-2.} The evolutionary history of the simian immunodeficiency virussooty {mangabey/HIV-2} lineage was reconstructed by using available database sequences with known sampling dates, and a timescale for this history was calculated by using maximum likelihood methods. The date of the most recent common ancestor of {HIV-2} subtype A strains was estimated to be 1940 $\pm$ 16 and that of B strains was estimated to be 1945 $\pm$ 14. In addition we used coalescent theory to estimate the past population dynamics of {HIV-2} subtype A in a rural population of {Guinea-Bissau.} Parametric and nonparametric estimates of the effective number of infections through time were obtained for an equal sample of gag, pol, and env sequences. Our estimates of the epidemic history of {HIV-2} subtype A in {Guinea-Bissau} show a transition from constant size to rapid exponential growth around 1955--1970. Our analysis provides evidence for a zoonotic transfer of {HIV-2} during the first half of the 20th century and an epidemic initiation in {Guinea-Bissau} that coincides with the independence war (1963--1974), suggesting that war-related changes in sociocultural patterns had a major impact on the {HIV-2} epidemic.},

	Abstract = {HIV-1 group O originated through cross-species transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans and has established a relatively low prevalence in Central Africa. Here, we infer the population genetics and epidemic history of HIV-1 group O from viral gene sequence data and evaluate the effect of variable evolutionary rates and recombination on our estimates. First, model selection tools were used to specify suitable evolutionary and coalescent models for HIV group O. Second, divergence times and population genetic parameters were estimated in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, under both strict and relaxed molecular clock methods. Our results date the origin of the group O radiation to around 1920 (1890-1940), a time frame similar to that estimated for HIV-1 group M. However, group O infections, which remain almost wholly restricted to Cameroon, show a slower rate of exponential growth during the twentieth century, explaining their lower current prevalence. To explore the effect of recombination, the Bayesian framework is extended to incorporate multiple unlinked loci. Although recombination can bias estimates of the time to the most recent common ancestor, this effect does not appear to be important for HIV-1 group O. In addition, we show that evolutionary rate estimates for different HIV genes accurately reflect differential selective constraints along the HIV genome.},

	Abstract = {The HIV evolutionary processes continuously unfold, leaving a measurable footprint in viral gene sequences. A variety of statistical models and inference techniques have been developed to reconstruct the HIV evolutionary history and to investigate the population genetic processes that shape viral diversity. Remarkably different population genetic forces are at work within and among hosts. Population-level HIV phylogenies are mainly shaped by selectively neutral epidemiologic processes, implying that genealogy-based population genetic inference can be useful to study the HIV epidemic history. Such evolutionary analyses have shed light on the origins of HIV, and on the epidemic spread of viral variants in different geographic locations and in different populations. The HIV genealogies reconstructed from within-host sequences indicate the action of selection pressure. In addition, recombination has a significant impact on HIV genetic diversity. Accurately quantifying both the adaptation rate and the population recombination rate of HIV will contribute to a better understanding of immune escape and drug resistance. Characterizing the impact of HIV transmission on viral genetic diversity will be a key factor in reconciling the different population genetic processes within and among hosts.},

	Abstract = {Upon HIV transmission, some patients develop AIDS in only a few months, while others remain disease free for 20 or more years. This variation in the rate of disease progression is poorly understood and has been attributed to host genetics, host immune responses, co-infection, viral genetics, and adaptation. Here, we develop a new "relaxed-clock" phylogenetic method to estimate absolute rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution through time. We identify an unexpected association between the synonymous substitution rate of HIV and disease progression parameters. Since immune activation is the major determinant of HIV disease progression, we propose that this process can also determine viral generation times, by creating favourable conditions for HIV replication. These conclusions may apply more generally to HIV evolution, since we also observed an overall low synonymous substitution rate for HIV-2, which is known to be less pathogenic than HIV-1 and capable of tempering the detrimental effects of immune activation. Humoral immune responses, on the other hand, are the major determinant of nonsynonymous rate changes through time in the envelope gene, and our relaxed-clock estimates support a decrease in selective pressure as a consequence of immune system collapse.},

	Abstract = {Here, we present an analysis of the {H1N1pdm} genetic data sampled over the initial stages in the epidemic. To infer phylodynamic spread in time and space we employ a recently developed Bayesian statistical inference framework {(Lemey} et al., in press). We model spatial diffusion as a continuous-time Markov chain process along time-measured genealogies. In this analysis, we consider 40 locations for which sequence data were available on {06-Aug-2009.} The sampling time interval of the 242 sequences spans from {30-Mar-2009} to {12-Jul-2009.} The Bayesian inference typically results in a posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees, each having an estimate of the epidemic locations at the ancestral nodes in the tree. We summarize these trees using the most representative clustering pattern and annotate these clusters with the most probable location states. We can visualize this information as tree that grows over time, seeding locations each time an ancestral node is inferred to exist at a different location. A Bayes factor test provides statistical support for epidemiological linkage throughout the evolutionary history. We demonstrate how our full probabilistic approach efficiently tracks an epidemic based on viral genetic data as it unfolds across the globe.},

	Abstract = {As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.},

	Abstract = {Research aimed at understanding the geographic context of evolutionary histories is burgeoning across biological disciplines. Recent endeavors attempt to interpret contemporaneous genetic variation in the light of increasingly detailed geographical and environmental observations. Such interest has promoted the development of phylogeographic inference techniques that explicitly aim to integrate such heterogeneous data. One promising development involves reconstructing phylogeographic history on a continuous landscape. Here, we present a Bayesian statistical approach to infer continuous phylogeographic diffusion using random walk models while simultaneously reconstructing the evolutionary history in time from molecular sequence data. Moreover, by accommodating branch-specific variation in dispersal rates, we relax the most restrictive assumption of the standard Brownian diffusion process and demonstrate increased statistical efficiency in spatial reconstructions of over-dispersed random walks by analyzing both simulated and real viral genetic data. We further illustrate how drawing inference about summary statistics from a fully-specified stochastic process over both sequence evolution and spatial movement reveals important characteristics of a rabies epidemic. Together with recent advances in discrete phylogeographic inference, the continuous model developments furnish a flexible statistical framework for biogeographical reconstructions that is easily expanded upon to accommodate various landscape genetic features.},

Human {H3N2} viruses isolated from 1968 to 1972 were also examined to investigate genetic events associated with their emergence in humans and to identify the putative {H2N2} ancestral virus. All gene segments of human {H2N2} viruses demonstrated divergent evolution into two distinct clades {(I} and {II)} among late {H2N2} isolates. All gene segments of 1968 {H3N2} viruses that were retained from human {H2N2} viruses were most similar to clade I {H2N2} genes. However, genes of both clades were found among {H3N2} isolates of 1969-1971. Unique phylogenic topologies reflected multiple reassortment events among late {H2N2} or {H3N2} viruses that resulted in a variety of different genome constellations. These results suggest that {H2N2} viruses continued to circulate after 1968 and that establishment of {H3N2} viruses in humans was associated with multiple reassortment events that contributed to their genetic diversity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {The development of an effective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 {(HIV-1)} vaccine is likely to depend on knowledge of circulating variants of genes other than the commonly sequenced gag and env genes. In addition, full-genome data are particularly limited for {HIV-1} subtype C, currently the most commonly transmitted subtype in India and worldwide. Likewise, little is known about sequence variation of {HIV-1} in India, the country facing the largest burden of {HIV} worldwide. Therefore, the objective of this study was to clone and characterize the complete genome of {HIV-1} from seroconverters infected with subtype C variants in India. Cocultured {HIV-1} isolates were obtained from six seroincident individuals from Pune, India, and virtually full-length {HIV-1} genomes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced from each. Sequence analysis revealed that five of the six genomes were of subtype C, while one was a mosaic of subtypes A and C, with multiple breakpoints in env, nef, and the 3' long terminal repeat as determined by both maximal [chi]2 analysis and phylogenetic bootstrapping. Sequences were compared for preservation of known cytotoxic T lymphocyte {(CTL)} epitopes. Compared with those of the {HIV-1LAI} sequence, 38\% of well-defined {CTL} epitopes were identical. The proportion of nonconservative substitutions for Env, at 61\%, was higher {(P} {\textless} 0.001) than those for Gag (24\%), Pol (18\%), and Nef (32\%). Therefore, characterized {CTL} epitopes demonstrated substantial differences from subtype B laboratory strains, which were most pronounced in Env. Because these clones were obtained from Indian seroconverters, they are likely to facilitate vaccine-related efforts in India by providing potential antigens for vaccine candidates as well as for assays of vaccine responsiveness.},

	Abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a recently developed technique for solving problems in Bayesian inference. Although typically less accurate than, for example, the frequently used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, they have greater flexibility because they do not require the specification of a likelihood function. For this reason considerable amounts of data can be analysed and more complex models can be used providing, thereby, a potential better fit of the model to the data. Since its first applications in the late 1990s its usage has been steadily increasing. The framework was originally developed to solve problems in population genetics. However, as its efficiency was recognized its popularity increased and, consequently, it started to be used in fields as diverse as phylogenetics, ecology, conservation, molecular evolution and epidemiology. While the ABC algorithm is still being greatly studied and alterations to it are being proposed, the statistical approach has already reached a level of maturity well demonstrated by the number of related computer packages that are being developed. As improved ABC algorithms are proposed, the expansion of the use of this method can only increase. In this paper we are going to depict the context that led to the development of ABC focusing on the field of infectious disease epidemiology. We are then going to describe its current usage in such field and present its most recent developments.},

	Abstract = {Many pathogens associated with chronic infections evolve so rapidly that strains found late in an infection have little in common with the initial strain. This raises questions at different levels of analysis because rapid within-host evolution affects the course of an infection, but it can also affect the possibility for natural selection to act at the between-host level. We present a nested approach that incorporates within-host evolutionary dynamics of a rapidly mutating virus (hepatitis C virus) targeted by a cellular cross-reactive immune response, into an epidemiological perspective. The viral trait we follow is the replication rate of the strain initiating the infection. We find that, even for rapidly evolving viruses, the replication rate of the initial strain has a strong effect on the fitness of an infection. Moreover, infections caused by slowly replicating viruses have the highest infection fitness (i.e., lead to more secondary infections), but strains with higher replication rates tend to dominate within a host in the long-term. We also study the effect of cross-reactive immunity and viral mutation rate on infection life history traits. For instance, because of the stochastic nature of our approach, we can identify factors affecting the outcome of the infection (acute or chronic infections). Finally, we show that anti-viral treatments modify the value of the optimal initial replication rate and that the timing of the treatment administration can have public health consequences due to within-host evolution. Our results support the idea that natural selection can act on the replication rate of rapidly evolving viruses at the between-host level. It also provides a mechanistic description of within-host constraints, such as cross-reactive immunity, and shows how these constraints affect the infection fitness. This model raises questions that can be tested experimentally and underlines the necessity to consider the evolution of quantitative traits to understand the outcome and the fitness of an infection.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is estimated to affect 130-180 million people worldwide. Although its origin is unknown, patterns of viral diversity suggest that HCV genotype 1 probably originated from West Africa. Previous attempts to estimate the spatiotemporal parameters of the virus, both globally and regionally, have suggested that epidemic HCV transmission began in 1900 and grew steadily until the late 1980s. However, epidemiological data suggest that the expansion of HCV may have occurred after the Second World War. The aim of our study was to elucidate the timescale and route of the global spread of HCV. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We show that the rarely sequenced HCV region (E2P7NS2) is more informative for molecular epidemiology studies than the more commonly used NS5B region. We applied phylodynamic methods to a substantial set of new E2P7NS2 and NS5B sequences, together with all available global HCV sequences with information in both of these genomic regions, in order to estimate the timescale and nature of the global expansion of the most prevalent HCV subtypes, 1a and 1b. We showed that transmission of subtypes 1a and 1b "exploded" between 1940 and 1980, with the spread of 1b preceding that of 1a by at least 16 y (95\% confidence interval 15-17). Phylogeographic analysis of all available NS5B sequences suggests that HCV subtypes 1a and 1b disseminated from the developed world to the developing countries. CONCLUSIONS: The evolutionary rate of HCV appears faster than previously suggested. The global spread of HCV coincided with the widespread use of transfused blood and blood products and with the expansion of intravenous drug use but slowed prior to the wide implementation of anti-HCV screening. Differences in the transmission routes associated with subtypes 1a and 1b provide an explanation of the relatively earlier expansion of 1b. Our data show that the most plausible route of the HCV dispersal was from developed countries to the developing world. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the origin and nature of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genetic diversity is critical for improving treatment and vaccine design, and such diversity is the sole source of information about the virus' epidemic history prior to its identification 20 years ago. In this paper, we study the molecular epidemiology of HCV genotype 2 in its region of endemic origin, west and central Africa. Our analysis includes 56 new and highly diverse HCV isolates sampled from infected individuals in Guinea-Bissau. By combining phylogenetic, geographical and epidemiological information, we find a previously unappreciated geographical structure in the diversity of HCV genotype 2, pointing to a history of eastwards spatial spread from the west African coast to Cameroon that took place over several centuries. Molecular clock analysis dates the common ancestor of HCV in Guinea-Bissau to 1470 (1414-1582). The phylogenetic position of isolates from Madagascar and Martinique suggests a role for the historical slave trade in the global dissemination of HCV and of the epidemic subtypes 2a and 2c. Coalescent-based estimates of epidemic growth indicate a rapid 20th-century spread of HCV genotype 2 in Cameroon that is absent in Guinea-Bissau. We discuss this contrast in the context of possible parenteral HCV exposure during public-health campaigns undertaken during the colonial era.},

	Abstract = {Kingman's coalescent process opens the door for estimation of population genetics model parameters from molecular sequences. One paramount parameter of interest is the effective population size. Temporal variation of this quantity characterizes the demographic history of a population. Because researchers are rarely able to choose a priori a deterministic model describing effective population size dynamics for data at hand, nonparametric curve-fitting methods based on multiple change-point (MCP) models have been developed. We propose an alternative to change-point modeling that exploits Gaussian Markov random fields to achieve temporal smoothing of the effective population size in a Bayesian framework. The main advantage of our approach is that, in contrast to MCP models, the explicit temporal smoothing does not require strong prior decisions. To approximate the posterior distribution of the population dynamics, we use efficient, fast mixing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian models. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed temporal smoothing method, named Bayesian skyride, successfully recovers ``true'' population size trajectories in all simulation scenarios and competes well with the MCP approaches without evoking strong prior assumptions.

	Abstract = {Chimpanzees and gorillas are the only non-human primates known to harbor viruses closely related to {HIV-1.} Phylogenetic analyses showed that gorillas acquired {SIVgor} from chimpanzees and viruses from the {SIVcpz/SIVgor} lineage have been transmitted to humans on at least 4 occasions leading to {HIV-1} groups M, N, O and P. To determine the geographic distribution, prevalence and species association of {SIVgor,} we conducted a comprehensive molecular epidemiological survey of wild gorillas in Central Africa. Gorilla faecal samples were collected in the home range of western lowland gorillas (n=2367) and eastern Grauer gorillas (n=183), and tested for {SIVgor} specific antibodies and nucleic acids. {SIVgor} antibody positive samples were identified at two sites in Cameroon, with no evidence of infection at 19 other sites, including three in the range of the eastern gorillas. In Cameroon, based on {DNA} and microsatellite analyses of a subset of samples, we estimated the prevalence of {SIVgor} to be 1.6\% (range 0\% to 4.6\%) which is significantly lower than the prevalence of {SIVcpzPtt} in chimpanzees (5.9\% ; range 0\% to 32\%). All newly identified {SIVgor} strains formed a monophyletic lineage within the {SIVcpz} radiation, closely related to {HIV-1} group O and P, and clustered according to their field site of origin. At one site, there was evidence for intergroup transmission and high intra-group prevalence. These isolated hot-spots of {SIVgor} infected gorilla communities could serve as a source for human infection. The overall low prevalence and sporadic distribution of {SIVgor} could suggest a decline of {SIVgor} in wild populations but it cannot be excluded that {SIVgor} is still more prevalent in other parts of the home range of gorillas.},

	Annote = {Resistance to the adamantane class of antiviral drugs by human {A/H3N2} influenza viruses currently exceeds 90\% in the United States and multiple Asian countries. Adamantane resistance is associated with a single amino acid change {(S31N)} in the M2 protein, which was shown to rapidly disseminate globally in 2005 in association with a genome reassortment event. However, the exact origin of influenza {A/H3N2} viruses carrying the {S31N} mutation has not been characterized, particularly in {South-East} Asia. We therefore conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the {HA,} {NA,} and M1/2 segments of viral isolates collected between 1997 and 2007 from temperate localities in the Northern hemisphere {(New} York State, United States, 492 isolates) and Southern hemisphere {(New} Zealand and Australia, 629 isolates) and a subtropical locality in {South-East} Asia {(Hong} Kong, 281 isolates). We find that although the {S31N} mutation was independently introduced at least 11 times, the vast majority of resistant viruses now circulating globally descend from a single introduction that was first detected in the summer of 2003 in Hong Kong. These resistant viruses were continually detected in Hong Kong throughout 2003-2005, acquired a novel {HA} through reassortment during the first part of 2005, and thereafter spread globally. The emergence and persistence of adamantane resistant viruses in Hong Kong further supports a source-sink model of global influenza virus ecology, in which {South-East} Asia experiences continuous viral activity and repeatedly seeds epidemics in temperate areas.},

	Abstract = {In conventional phylogeographic studies, historical demographic processes are elucidated from the geographical distribution of individuals represented on an inferred gene tree. However, the interpretation of gene trees in this context can be difficult as the same demographic/geographical process can randomly lead to multiple different genealogies. Likewise, the same gene trees can arise under different demographic models. This problem has led to the emergence of many statistical methods for making phylogeographic inferences. A popular phylogeographic approach based on nested clade analysis is challenged by the fact that a certain amount of the interpretation of the data is left to the subjective choices of the user, and it has been argued that the method performs poorly in simulation studies. More rigorous statistical methods based on coalescence theory have been developed. However, these methods may also be challenged by computational problems or poor model choice. In this review, we will describe the development of statistical methods in phylogeographic analysis, and discuss some of the challenges facing these methods.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a theory to explain the development of immunodeficiency disease after a long and variable incubation period of infection with HIV-1. Two assumptions are central to the theory: (1) mutation via reverse transcription during viral replication can generate viral strains resistant to neutralization by antibodies specific to earlier mutants in a particular host; (2) the virus can kill the CD4-positive lymphocytes that play a role in mounting an immunological attack directed at the virus. The theory is examined via the development of a mathematical model which reveals that an increasing number of antigenically distinct viral strains may overwhelm the immune system of the host. As the viral diversity increases beyond a certain level the immune system is unable to suppress the population growth of all the strains simultaneously. The intuitive explanation of this pattern of model behaviour lies in the assumption that each virus can kill CD4-positive lymphocytes that are specific to any of the viral strains, but each lymphocyte only directs immunological attack against a single viral strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Data from a small number of infected patients show temporal changes in the number of genetically distinct strains of the virus throughout the incubation period, with a slow but steady rise in diversity during the progression to disease. A mathematical model of the dynamic interaction between viral diversity and the human immune system suggests the existence of an antigen diversity threshold, below which the immune system is able to regulate viral population growth but above which the virus population induces the collapse of the CD4+ lymphocyte population. The model suggests that antigenic diversity is the cause, not a consequence, of immunodeficiency disease. The model is compared with available data, and is used to assess how the timing of the application of chemotherapy or immunotherapy influences the rate of progress to disease.},

	Abstract = {Accurate reconstruction of the divergence times among individuals is an essential step toward inferring population parameters from genetic data. However, our ability to reconstruct accurate genealogies is often thwarted by the evolutionary forces we hope to detect, most prominently natural selection. Here, I demonstrate that purifying selection acting at many linked sites can systematically bias current methods of genealogical reconstruction, and I present a new method that corrects for this bias by allowing a class of sites to have a time-dependent rate. The parameters influencing the time dependency can be estimated from the data, allowing for a general method to detect the presence of selected sites and correcting for their distortion of the apparent mutation rate. The method works well under a variety of scenarios, including gamma-distributed selection coefficients as well as entirely neutral evolution. I also compare the performance of the new method to relaxed clock models, and I demonstrate the method on a data set from the mitochondrion of the North Atlantic whale-"louse" Cyamus ovalis.},

	Abstract = {Coalescent theory provides an elegant and powerful method for understanding the shape of gene genealogies and resulting patterns of genetic diversity. However, the coalescent does not naturally accommodate the effects of heritable variation in fitness. Although some methods are available for studying the effects of strong selection (Ns >> 1), few tools beyond forward simulation are available for quantifying the impact of weak selection at many sites. Here, we introduce a continuous-state coalescent capable of accurately describing the distortions to genealogies caused by moderate to weak natural selection affecting many linked sites. We calculate approximately the full distribution of pairwise coalescent times, the lengths of coalescent intervals, and the time to the most recent common ancestor of a sample. Weak selection (Ns approximately 1) is found to substantially decrease the tree depth, primarily through a shortening of the lengths of the basal coalescent intervals. Additionally, we demonstrate that only two parameters, population size and the variance of the distribution describing fitness heritability, are sufficient to describe most changes.},

Two distinct genotypes of {HIV-1,} A and B, were found to segregate by mode of transmission. Of 29 sexually infected patients, 25 (86\%) had {HIV-1} of genotype A and 4 (14\%) had genotype B. Among 29 injecting drug users, probably parenterally infected, only 7 (24\%) had genotype A and 22 (76\%) had genotype B. This segregation is unlikely to have arisen by chance (p{\textless}0�001). No patient was found to have dual infection. Nucleotide divergence averaged 3�4\% among {genotype-A-infected} patients and 3�5\% among {genotype-B-infected} patients, but 22�0\% between the genotypes. 37 of 40 isolates (both genotypes) had the G {PGQ} tetrapeptide at the tip of the V3 loop, which is common in African {HIV-1} strains but rare in North American and European strains, where the {GPGR} motif predominates.
These findings suggest that the waves of {HIV-1} infection in injecting drug users and in sexually infected patients in Thailand may not be epidemiologically linked. The nucleotide divergence data point to the separate introductions of the two genotypes into Thailand. Further studies in Thailand and neighbouring countries will be useful in the design and selection of candidate {HIV} vaccines.},

	Abstract = {Summary: Host range is a viral property reflecting natural hosts that are infected either as part of a principal transmission cycle or, less commonly, as "spillover" infections into alternative hosts. Rarely, viruses gain the ability to spread efficiently within a new host that was not previously exposed or susceptible. These transfers involve either increased exposure or the acquisition of variations that allow them to overcome barriers to infection of the new hosts. In these cases, devastating outbreaks can result. Steps involved in transfers of viruses to new hosts include contact between the virus and the host, infection of an initial individual leading to amplification and an outbreak, and the generation within the original or new host of viral variants that have the ability to spread efficiently between individuals in populations of the new host. Here we review what is known about host switching leading to viral emergence from known examples, considering the evolutionary mechanisms, virus-host interactions, host range barriers to infection, and processes that allow efficient host-to-host transmission in the new host population.},

	Abstract = {We extend the one-locus two allele Moran model of fixation in a haploid population to the case where the total size of the population is not fixed. The model is defined as a two-dimensional birth-and-death process for allele number. Changes in allele number occur through density-independent death events and birth events whose per capita rate decreases linearly with the total population density. Uniquely for models of this type, the latter is determined by these same birth-and-death events. This provides a framework for investigating both the effects of fluctuation in total population number through demographic stochasticity, and deterministic density-dependent changes in mean density, on allele fixation. We analyze this model using a combination of asymptotic analytic approximations supported by numerics. We find that for advantageous mutants demographic stochasticity of the resident population does not affect the fixation probability, but that deterministic changes in total density do. In contrast, for deleterious mutants, the fixation probability increases with increasing resident population fluctuation size, but is relatively insensitive to initial density. These phenomena cannot be described by simply using a harmonic mean effective population size.},

	Abstract = {Much of population genetics is based on the diffusion limit of the Wright-Fisher model, which assumes a fixed population size. This assumption is violated in most natural populations, particularly for microbes. Here we study a more realistic model that decouples birth and death events and allows for a stochastically varying population size. Under this model, classical quantities such as the probability of and time before fixation of a mutant allele can differ dramatically from their Wright-Fisher expectations. Moreover, inferences about natural selection based on Wright-Fisher assumptions can yield erroneous and even contradictory conclusions: at small population densities one allele will appear superior, whereas at large densities the other allele will dominate. Consequently, competition assays in laboratory conditions may not reflect the outcome of long-term evolution in the field. These results highlight the importance of incorporating demographic stochasticity into basic models of population genetics.},

Productively infected cells were estimated to have, on average, a life-span of 2.2 days (half-life t 1/2 = 1.6 days), and plasma virions were estimated to have a mean life-span of 0.3 days (t 1/2 = 0.24 days). The estimated average total HIV-1 production was 10.3 x 10(9) virions per day, which is substantially greater than previous minimum estimates. The results also suggest that the minimum duration of the HIV-1 life cycle in vivo is 1.2 days on average, and that the average HIV-1 generation time--defined as the time from release of a virion until it infects another cell and causes the release of a new generation of viral particles--is 2.6 days.

These models also need to take into account the non-independence of sequences due to their shared evolutionary history.

However, the relative fitness of these mutations is largely unknown, although this information is central to our understanding of viral emergence, immune evasion, and drug resistance. Here we develop a phylogenetic method, based on the distribution of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes, to assess the relative fitness of polymorphisms in the structural genes of 143 RNA viruses. This reveals that a substantial proportion of the amino acid variation observed in natural populations of RNA viruses comprises transient deleterious mutations that are later purged by purifying selection, potentially limiting virus adaptability. We also demonstrate, for the first time, the existence of a relationship between amino acid variability and the phylogenetic distribution of polymorphisms. From this relationship, we propose an empirical threshold for the maximum viable deleterious mutation load in RNA viruses.},

Although HCV spread epidemically during the 20th century, particularly by blood transfusion, it has clearly been present in human populations for several centuries. Here we attempt to redress the paucity of investigation into how long-term endemic transmission of HCV has been maintained. Such transmission not only represents the 'natural' route of infection but also contributes to new infections today. As a first step, we investigate the hypothesis that HCV can be mechanically transmitted by biting arthropods. Firstly, we use a combined bioinformatic and geographic approach to build a spatial database of endemic HCV infection and demonstrate that this can be used to geographically compare endemic HCV with the range distributions of potential vector species. Second, we use models from mathematical epidemiology to investigate if the parameters that describe the biting behaviour of vectors are consistent with a proposed basic reproduction number (R0) for HCV, and with the sustained transmission of the virus by mechanical transmission. Our analyses indicate that the mechanical transmission of HCV is plausible and that much further research into endemic HCV is needed.},

Here we use newly developed methods of sequence analysis to conduct the first comprehensive investigation of the epidemic and evolutionary history of HCV in Asia. Our analysis includes new HCV core (n = 16) and NS5B (n = 14) gene sequences, obtained from serum samples of jaundiced patients from Laos. These exceptionally diverse isolates were analyzed in conjunction with all available reference strains using phylogenetic and Bayesian coalescent methods. We performed statistical tests of phylogeographic structure and applied a recently developed "relaxed molecular clock" approach to HCV for the first time, which indicated an unexpectedly high degree of rate variation. Our results reveal a >1,000-year-long development of genotype 6 in Asia, characterized by substantial phylogeographic structure and two distinct phases of epidemic history, before and during the 20th century. We conclude that HCV lineages representing preexisting and spatially restricted strains were involved in multiple, independent local epidemics during the 20th century. Our analysis explains the generation and maintenance of HCV diversity in Asia and could provide a template for further investigations of HCV spread in other regions.},

	Abstract = {Many organisms that cause infectious diseases, particularly RNA viruses, mutate so rapidly that their evolutionary and ecological behaviours are inextricably linked. Consequently, aspects of the transmission and epidemiology of these pathogens are imprinted on the genetic diversity of their genomes. Large-scale empirical analyses of the evolutionary dynamics of important pathogens are now feasible owing to the increasing availability of pathogen sequence data and the development of new computational and statistical methods of analysis. In this Review, we outline the questions that can be answered using viral evolutionary analysis across a wide range of biological scales.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: TipDate is a program that will use sequences that have been isolated at different dates to estimate their rate of molecular evolution. The program provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the rate and also the associated date of the most recent common ancestor of the sequences, under a model which assumes a constant rate of substitution (molecular clock) but which accommodates the dates of isolation. Confidence intervals for these parameters are also estimated. RESULTS: The approach was applied to a sample of 17 dengue virus serotype 4 sequences, isolated at dates ranging from 1956 to 1994. The rate of substitution for this serotype was estimated to be 7.91 x 10(-4) substitutions per site per year (95\% confidence intervals of 6.07 x 10(-4), 9.86 x 10(-4)). This is compatible with a date of 1922 (95\% confidence intervals of 1900-1936) for the most recent common ancestor of these sequences. AVAILABILITY: TipDate can be obtained by WWW from http://evolve.zoo. ox.ac.uk/software. The package includes the source code, manual and example files. Both UNIX and Apple Macintosh versions are available from the same site.},

	Abstract = {The evolutionary interaction between influenza A virus and the human immune system, manifest as 'antigenic drift' of the viral haemagglutinin, is one of the best described patterns in molecular evolution. However, little is known about the genome-scale evolutionary dynamics of this pathogen. Similarly, how genomic processes relate to global influenza epidemiology, in which the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes co-circulate, is poorly understood. Here through an analysis of 1,302 complete viral genomes sampled from temperate populations in both hemispheres, we show that the genomic evolution of influenza A virus is characterized by a complex interplay between frequent reassortment and periodic selective sweeps. The A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes exhibit different evolutionary dynamics, with diverse lineages circulating in A/H1N1, indicative of weaker antigenic drift. These results suggest a sink-source model of viral ecology in which new lineages are seeded from a persistent influenza reservoir, which we hypothesize to be located in the tropics, to sink populations in temperate regions.},

Currently sampled H1N1pdm sequences share a most recent common ancestor in the first 7 weeks of 2009 with the implication that the virus was transmitting cryptically for up to 3 months prior to recognition.

Here, we report the complete sequence of the hemagglutinin {(HA)} gene of the 1918 virus. Influenza {RNA} for the analysis was isolated from a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue sample prepared during the autopsy of a victim of the influenza pandemic in 1918. Influenza {RNA} was also isolated from lung tissue samples from two additional victims of the lethal 1918 influenza: one formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sample and one frozen sample obtained by in situ biopsy of the lung of a victim buried in permafrost since 1918. The complete coding sequence of the {A/South} Carolina/1/18 {HA} gene was obtained. The {HA1} domain sequence was confirmed by using the two additional isolates {(A/New} York/1/18 and {A/Brevig} Mission/1/18). The sequences show little variation. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the 1918 virus {HA} gene, although more closely related to avian strains than any other mammalian sequence, is mammalian and may have been adapting in humans before 1918.},

	Abstract = {Sequence analysis can be used to evaluate transmission networks. We have used retrospective samples to examine two {HIV-1} transmission networks established by contact tracing. Regions of the {HIV-1} region representing segments of gag and env were amplified by {RT-PCR} from frozen plasma samples and the sequence of each {PCR} product was determined. Within one of the networks (composed of 38 subjects) we found only a subset of the tested sequence clusters was consistent with the reported epidemiological linkage. Of 15 presumed transmission events where sequence data were available, 9 could be rejected either by subtype mismatch or by phylogenetic tests. In the other network (composed of 89 subjects) we were able to assess sequences for 26 presumed transmission events, 18 of which were rejected based on subtype discordance. Long lags in time between the time of transmission and the time of sequence sampling (ranging from 2 to 18 years) may limit the sensitivity for the detection of sequence linkage. Also, superinfection and incomplete epidemiological information are other factors that will limit the concordance of phylogenetic reconstruction and reported epidemiological linkage.},

	Annote = {The sudden appearance and potential lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus {(SARS-CoV)} in humans has focused attention on understanding its origins. Here, we assess phylogenetic relationships for the {SARS-CoV} lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts for {SARS-CoV} and other coronaviruses. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three {SARS-CoV} proteins: {RNA} dependent {RNA} polymerase {(RDRP),} nucleocapsid {(N)} and spike {(S).} Conservation of {RDRP} allowed us to use a set of Arteriviridae taxa to root the Coronaviridae phylogeny. We found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within {SARS-CoV} {RDRP,} based on different, well supported trees for a 5' fragment (supporting {SARS-CoV} as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses) and a 3' fragment (supporting {SARS-CoV} as sister to group three avian coronaviruses). These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5' tree could be rejected for the 3' region, and the optimal 3' tree could be rejected for the 5' region. We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees. Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1-3 and {SARS-CoV,} based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses. Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously. However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, mammals and manx shearwater, and humans and other mammals. The sister relationship between avian coronaviruses and the 3' {RDRP} fragment of {SARS-CoV} suggests an additional host-species shift. Demonstration of recombination in the {SARS-CoV} lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development.},

Here, we describe a new method based on coalescence theory that allows the estimate of generation times to be derived by using nucleotide sequence data and a reconstructed genealogy of sequences obtained over time. The method is applied to sequences obtained from a long-term nonprogressing individual at five sampling occasions. The estimate of viral generation time using the coalescent method is 1.2 days per generation and is close to that obtained by mathematical modeling (1.8 days per generation), thus strengthening confidence in estimates of a short viral generation time. Apart from the estimation of relevant parameters relating to viral dynamics, coalescent modeling also allows us to simulate the evolutionary behavior of samples of sequences obtained over time.},

To address this issue, we have developed a simple virus population model, within which the relative importance of stochastic factors and purifying selection for genetic evolution differs over, at least, three broad intervals of the effective population size, with approximate boundaries given by the inverse selection coefficient and the inverse mutation rate per base per cycle. Random drift and selection dominate the smallest (stochastic) and largest (deterministic) population intervals, respectively. In the intermediate (selection-drift) interval, random drift controls weakly diverse populations, whereas strongly diverse populations are controlled by selection. To estimate the effective size of the HIV population in vivo, we tested 200 pro sequences isolated from 11 HIV-infected patients for the presence of a linkage disequilibrium effect which must exist only in small populations. This analysis demonstrated a steady-state virus population of 10(5) infected cells or more, which is either in or at the border of the deterministic regime with respect to evolution of separate bases.},

We develop a simple one-locus, two-allele model of a haploid population of constant size including the factors of random drift, purifying selection, and random mutation. We consider different virological experiments: accumulation and reversion of deleterious mutations, competition between mutant and wild-type viruses, gene fixation, mutation frequencies at the steady state, divergence of two populations split from one population, and genetic turnover within a single population. In the first part of the review, we present all principal results in qualitative terms and illustrate them with examples obtained by computer simulation. In the second part, we derive the results formally from a diffusion equation of the Wright-Fisher type and boundary conditions, all derived from the first principles for the virus population model. We show that the leading factors and observable behavior of evolution differ significantly in three broad intervals of population size, N. The "neutral limit" is reached when N is smaller than the inverse selection coefficient. When N is larger than the inverse mutation rate per base, selection dominates and evolution is "almost" deterministic. If the selection coefficient is much larger than the mutation rate, there exists a broad interval of population sizes, in which weakly diverse populations are almost neutral while highly diverse populations are controlled by selection pressure. We discuss in detail the application of our results to human immunodeficiency virus population in vivo, sampling effects, and limitations of the model.},

	Abstract = {Earlier, using the semi-deterministic solitary wave approach, we have investigated accumulation of pre-existing beneficial alleles in genomes consisting of a large number of simultaneously evolving sites in the presence of selection and infrequent recombination with small rate r per genome. Our previous results for the dynamics of the fitness distribution of genomes are now interpreted in terms of the life cycle of recombinant clones. We show that, at sufficiently small r, the clones dominating fitness classes, at the moment of their birth, are nearly the best fit in a population. New progeny clones are mostly generated by parental genomes whose fitness falls within a narrow interval in the middle of the high-fitness tail of fitness distribution. We also derive the fitness distribution for the distant ancestors of sites of a randomly sampled genome and show that its form is controlled by a single composite model parameter proportional to r. The ancestral fitness distribution differs dramatically from the fitness distribution of the entire ancient population: it is much broader and localized in the high-fitness tail of the ancient population. We generalize these results to the case of moderately small r to conclude that, regardless of fitness of an individual, all its distant ancestors are exceptionally well fit.},

	Abstract = {Attempts to estimate the time of origin of human immunodeficiency virus {(HIV)-1} by using phylogenetic analysis are seriously flawed because of the unequal evolutionary rates among different viral lineages. Here, we report a new method of molecular clock analysis, called Site Stripping for Clock Detection {(SSCD),} which allows selection of nucleotide sites evolving at an equal rate in different lineages. The method was validated on a dataset of patients all infected with hepatitis C virus in 1977 by the same donor, and it was able to date exactly the �known� origin of the infection. Using the same method, we calculated that the origin of {HIV-1} group M radiation was in the 1930s. In addition, we show that the coalescence time of the simian ancestor of {HIV-1} group M and its closest related cpz strains occurred around the end of the {XVII} century, a date that could be considered the upper limit to the time of simian-to-human transmission of {HIV-1} group M. The results show also that {SSCD} is an easy-to-use method of general applicability in molecular evolution to calibrate clock-like phylogenetic trees. Key words: interspecies transmission � molecular clock},

Both subtypes are growing exponentially, although the HIV-1A epidemic displays a faster growth rate, and a significantly higher basic reproductive number R<sub>0</sub>. HIV-1A gene flow occurs primarily from the capital Tirane, in the center of the country, to the periphery, while HIV-1B flow is characterized by a balanced exchange between center and periphery.

	Abstract = {Rates of molecular evolution vary widely between lineages, but quantification of how rates change has proven difficult. Recently proposed estimation procedures have mainly adopted highly parametric approaches that model rate evolution explicitly. In this study, a semiparametric smoothing method is developed using penalized likelihood. A saturated model in which every lineage has a separate rate is combined with a roughness penalty that discourages rates from varying too much across a phylogeny. A data-driven cross-validation criterion is then used to determine an optimal level of smoothing. This criterion is based on an estimate of the average prediction error associated with pruning lineages from the tree. The methods are applied to three data sets of six genes across a sample of land plants. Optimally smoothed estimates of absolute rates entailed 2- to 10-fold variation across lineages.},

	Abstract = {Aim Oceanic islands represent a special challenge to historical biogeographers because dispersal is typically the dominant process while most existing methods are based on vicariance. Here, we describe a new Bayesian approach to island biogeography that estimates island carrying capacities and dispersal rates based on simple Markov models of biogeographical processes. This is done in the context of simultaneous analysis of phylogenetic and distributional data across groups, accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty and making parameter estimates more robust. We test our models on an empirical data set of published phylogenies of Canary Island organisms to examine overall dispersal rates and correlation of rates with explanatory factors such as geographic proximity and area {size.Location}  Oceanic archipelagos with special reference to the Atlantic Canary {Islands.Methods}  The Canary Islands were divided into three island-groups, corresponding to the main magmatism periods in the formation of the archipelago, while {non-Canarian} distributions were grouped into a fourth 'mainland-island'. Dispersal between island groups, which were assumed constant through time, was modelled as a homogeneous, time-reversible Markov process, analogous to the standard models of {DNA} evolution. The stationary state frequencies in these models reflect the relative carrying capacity of the islands, while the exchangeability (rate) parameters reflect the relative dispersal rates between islands. We examined models of increasing complexity: {Jukes2013Cantor} {(JC),} Equal-in, and General Time Reversible {(GTR),} with or without the assumption of stepping-stone dispersal. The data consisted of 13 Canarian phylogenies: 954 individuals representing 393 taxonomic (morphological) entities. Each group was allowed to evolve under its own {DNA} model, with the island-model shared across groups. Posterior distributions on island model parameters were estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo {(MCMC)} sampling, as implemented in {MrBayes} 4.0, and Bayes Factors were used to compare {models.Results}  The Equal-in step, the {GTR,} and the {GTR} step dispersal models showed the best fit to the data. In the Equal-in and {GTR} models, the largest carrying capacity was estimated for the mainland, followed by the central islands and the western islands, with the eastern islands having the smallest carrying capacity. The relative dispersal rate was highest between the central and eastern islands, and between the central and western islands. The exchange with the mainland was rare in {comparison.Main} conclusions  Our results confirm those of earlier studies suggesting that inter-island dispersal within the Canary Island archipelago has been more important in explaining diversification within lineages than dispersal between the continent and the islands, despite the close proximity to North Africa. The low carrying capacity of the eastern islands, uncorrelated with their size or age, fits well with the idea of a historically depauperate biota in these islands but more sophisticated models are needed to address the possible influence of major recent extinction events. The island models explored here can easily be extended to address other problems in historical biogeography, such as dispersal among areas in continental settings or reticulate area relationships.},

Here, we report the first molecular epidemiological survey of {SIVsmm} in a community of [{\textasciitilde}]120 free-ranging sooty mangabeys in the Tai Forest, Cote {d'Ivoire.} Fecal samples (n = 39) were collected from 35 habituated animals (27 females and 8 males) and tested for {SIVsmm} virion {RNA} {(vRNA).} Viral gag (800 bp) and/or env (490 bp) sequences were amplified from 11 different individuals (eight females and three males). Based on the sensitivity of fecal {vRNA} detection and the numbers of samples analyzed, the prevalence of {SIVsmm} infection was estimated to be 59\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.88). Behavioral data collected from this community indicated that {SIVsmm} infection occurred preferentially in high-ranking females. Phylogenetic analysis of gag and env sequences revealed an extraordinary degree of genetic diversity, including evidence for frequent recombination events in both the recent and distant past. Some sooty mangabeys harbored near-identical viruses ({\textless}2\% interstrain distance), indicating epidemiologically linked infections. These transmissions were identified by microsatellite analyses to involve both related (mother/daughter) and unrelated individuals, thus providing evidence for vertical and horizontal transmission in the wild. Finally, evolutionary tree analyses revealed significant clustering of the Tai {SIVsmm} strains with five of the eight recognized groups of {HIV-2,} including the epidemic groups A and B, thus pointing to a likely geographic origin of these human infections in the eastern part of the sooty mangabey range.},

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Estimates} of divergence dates between species improve our understanding of processes ranging from nucleotide substitution to speciation. Such estimates are frequently based on molecular genetic differences between species; therefore, they rely on accurate estimates of the number of such differences (i.e. substitutions per site, measured as branch length on phylogenies). We used simulations to determine the effects of dataset size, branch length heterogeneity, branch depth, and analytical framework on branch length estimation across a range of branch lengths. We then reanalyzed an empirical dataset for plethodontid salamanders to determine how inaccurate branch length estimation can affect estimates of divergence {dates.RESULTS:The} accuracy of branch length estimation varied with branch length, dataset size (both number of taxa and sites), branch length heterogeneity, branch depth, dataset complexity, and analytical framework. For simple phylogenies analyzed in a Bayesian framework, branches were increasingly underestimated as branch length increased; in a maximum likelihood framework, longer branch lengths were somewhat overestimated. Longer datasets improved estimates in both frameworks; however, when the number of taxa was increased, estimation accuracy for deeper branches was less than for tip branches. Increasing the complexity of the dataset produced more misestimated branches in a Bayesian framework; however, in an {ML} framework, more branches were estimated more accurately. Using {ML} branch length estimates to re-estimate plethodontid salamander divergence dates generally resulted in an increase in the estimated age of older nodes and a decrease in the estimated age of younger {nodes.CONCLUSIONS:Branch} lengths are misestimated in both statistical frameworks for simulations of simple datasets. However, for complex datasets, length estimates are quite accurate in {ML} (even for short datasets), whereas few branches are estimated accurately in a Bayesian framework. Our reanalysis of empirical data demonstrates the magnitude of effects of Bayesian branch length misestimation on divergence date estimates. Because the length of branches for empirical datasets can be estimated most reliably in an {ML} framework when branches are {\textless}1 substitution/site and datasets are [greater than or equal to]1 kb, we suggest that divergence date estimates using datasets, branch lengths, and/or analytical techniques that fall outside of these parameters should be interpreted with caution.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: The high pace of viral sequence change means that
variation in the times at which sequences are sampled can have a
profound effect both on the ability to detect trends over time in
evolutionary rates and on the power to reject the Molecular Clock
Hypothesis {(MCH).} Trends in viral evolutionary rates are of
particular interest because their detection may allow connections to
be established between a patient's treatment or condition and
the process of evolution. Variation in sequence isolation times also
impacts the uncertainty associated with estimates of divergence
times and evolutionary rates. Variation in isolation times can be
intentionally adjusted to increase the power of hypothesis tests and
to reduce the uncertainty of evolutionary parameter estimates, but
this fact has received little previous {attention.Results:} We provide approximations for the power to reject the
{MCH} when the alternative is that rates change in a linear fashion
over time and when the alternative is that rates differ randomly
among branches. In addition, we approximate the standard deviation
of estimated evolutionary rates and divergence times. We illustrate
how these approximations can be exploited to determine which viral
sample to sequence when samples representing different dates are

The only species naturally infected with viruses closely related to {HIV--2} is the sooty mangabey {(Cercocebus} atys) from western Africa, the region where {HIV--2} is known to be endemic. Similarly, the only viruses very closely related to {HIV--1} have been isolated from chimpanzees {(Pan} troglodytes), and in particular those from western equatorial Africa, again coinciding with the region that appears to be the hearth of the {HIV--1} pandemic. {HIV--1} and {HIV--2} have each arisen several times: in the case of {HIV--1,} the three groups {(M,} N and O) are the result of independent cross--species transmission events. Consistent with the phylogenetic position of a `fossil' virus from 1959, molecular clock analyses using realistic models of {HIV--1} sequence evolution place the last common ancestor of the M group prior to 1940, and several lines of evidence indicate that the jump from chimpanzees to humans occurred before then. Both the inferred geographical origin of {HIV--1} and the timing of the cross--species transmission are inconsistent with the suggestion that oral polio vaccines, putatively contaminated with viruses from chimpanzees in eastern equatorial Africa in the late 1950s, could be responsible for the origin of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.},

	Abstract = {The major cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome {(AIDS)} is human immunodeficiency virus type 1 {(HIV-1).} We have been using evolutionary comparisons to trace (i) the origin(s) of {HIV-1} and (ii) the origin(s) of {AIDS.} The closest relatives of {HIV-1} are simian immunodeficiency viruses {(SIVs)} infecting wild-living chimpanzees {(Pan} troglodytes troglodytes) and gorillas {(Gorilla} gorilla gorilla) in west central Africa. Phylogenetic analyses have revealed the origins of {HIV-1:} chimpanzees were the original hosts of this clade of viruses; four lineages of {HIV-1} have arisen by independent cross-species transmissions to humans and one or two of those transmissions may have been via gorillas. However, {SIVs} are primarily monkey viruses: more than 40 species of African monkeys are infected with their own, species-specific, {SIV} and in at least some host species, the infection seems non-pathogenic. Chimpanzees acquired from monkeys two distinct forms of {SIVs} that recombined to produce a virus with a unique genome structure. We have found that {SIV} infection causes {CD4+} T-cell depletion and increases mortality in wild chimpanzees, and so the origin of {AIDS} is more ancient than the origin of {HIV-1.} Tracing the genetic changes that occurred as monkey viruses adapted to infect first chimpanzees and then humans may provide insights into the causes of the pathogenicity of these viruses.},

	Abstract = {Noroviruses are the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis. An increase in the number of globally reported norovirus outbreaks was seen the past decade, especially for outbreaks caused by successive genogroup II genotype 4 (GII.4) variants. Whether this observed increase was due to an upswing in the number of infections, or to a surveillance artifact caused by heightened awareness and concomitant improved reporting, remained unclear. Therefore, we set out to study the population structure and changes thereof of GII.4 strains detected through systematic outbreak surveillance since the early 1990s. We collected 1383 partial polymerase and 194 full capsid GII.4 sequences. A Bayesian MCMC coalescent analysis revealed an increase in the number of GII.4 infections during the last decade. The GII.4 strains included in our analyses evolved at a rate of 4.3-9.0x10(-3) mutations per site per year, and share a most recent common ancestor in the early 1980s. Determinants of adaptation in the capsid protein were studied using different maximum likelihood approaches to identify sites subject to diversifying or directional selection and sites that co-evolved. While a number of the computationally determined adaptively evolving sites were on the surface of the capsid and possible subject to immune selection, we also detected sites that were subject to constrained or compensatory evolution due to secondary RNA structures, relevant in virus-replication. We highlight codons that may prove useful in identifying emerging novel variants, and, using these, indicate that the novel 2008 variant is more likely to cause a future epidemic than the 2007 variant. While norovirus infections are generally mild and self-limiting, more severe outcomes of infection frequently occur in elderly and immunocompromized people, and no treatment is available. The observed pattern of continually emerging novel variants of GII.4, causing elevated numbers of infections, is therefore a cause for concern.},

	Abstract = {In March and early April 2009, a new swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) emerged in Mexico and the United States. During the first few weeks of surveillance, the virus spread worldwide to 30 countries (as of May 11) by human-to-human transmission, causing the World Health Organization to raise its pandemic alert to level 5 of 6. This virus has the potential to develop into the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century. Here we use evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale of the origins and the early development of the S-OIV epidemic. We show that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine, and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak. A phylogenetic estimate of the gaps in genetic surveillance indicates a long period of unsampled ancestry before the S-OIV outbreak, suggesting that the reassortment of swine lineages may have occurred years before emergence in humans, and that the multiple genetic ancestry of S-OIV is not indicative of an artificial origin. Furthermore, the unsampled history of the epidemic means that the nature and location of the genetically closest swine viruses reveal little about the immediate origin of the epidemic, despite the fact that we included a panel of closely related and previously unpublished swine influenza isolates. Our results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of influenza in swine, and provide evidence that the mixing of new genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans.},

	Abstract = {Pandemic influenza viruses cause significant mortality in humans. In the 20th century, 3 influenza viruses caused major pandemics: the 1918 H1N1 virus, the 1957 H2N2 virus, and the 1968 H3N2 virus. These pandemics were initiated by the introduction and successful adaptation of a novel hemagglutinin subtype to humans from an animal source, resulting in antigenic shift. Despite global concern regarding a new pandemic influenza, the emergence pathway of pandemic strains remains unknown. Here we estimated the evolutionary history and inferred date of introduction to humans of each of the genes for all 20th century pandemic influenza strains. Our results indicate that genetic components of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus circulated in mammalian hosts, i.e., swine and humans, as early as 1911 and was not likely to be a recently introduced avian virus. Phylogenetic relationships suggest that the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 virus (BM/1918) was generated by reassortment between mammalian viruses and a previously circulating human strain, either in swine or, possibly, in humans. Furthermore, seasonal and classic swine H1N1 viruses were not derived directly from BM/1918, but their precursors co-circulated during the pandemic. Mean estimates of the time of most recent common ancestor also suggest that the H2N2 and H3N2 pandemic strains may have been generated through reassortment events in unknown mammalian hosts and involved multiple avian viruses preceding pandemic recognition. The possible generation of pandemic strains through a series of reassortment events in mammals over a period of years before pandemic recognition suggests that appropriate surveillance strategies for detection of precursor viruses may abort future pandemics.},

Concurrent with this increase have come improvements to the sophisticated and generalized statistical techniques used for extracting population-level information from genetic sequence data. However, little research has been done on how the collection of these viral sequence data can or does affect the efficacy of the phylogenetic algorithms used to analyse and interpret them. In this study, we use epidemic simulations to consider how the collection of viral sequence data clarifies or distorts the picture, provided by the phylogenetic algorithms, of the underlying population dynamics of the simulated viral infection over many epidemic cycles. We find that sampling protocols purposefully designed to capture sequences at specific points in the epidemic cycle, such as is done for seasonal influenza surveillance, lead to a significantly better view of the underlying population dynamics than do less-focused collection protocols. Our results suggest that the temporal distribution of samples can have a significant effect on what can be inferred from genetic data, and thus highlight the importance of considering this distribution when designing or evaluating protocols and analysing the data collected thereunder.},

	Abstract = {The constant rate birth-death process is used as a stochastic model for many biological systems, for example phylogenies or disease transmission. As the biological data are usually not fully available, it is crucial to understand the effect of incomplete sampling. In this paper, we analyze the constant rate birth-death process with incomplete sampling. We derive the density of the bifurcation events for trees on n leaves which evolved under this birth-death-sampling process. This density is used for calculating prior distributions in Bayesian inference programs and for efficiently simulating trees. We show that the birth-death-sampling process can be interpreted as a birth-death process with reduced rates and complete sampling. This shows that joint inference of birth rate, death rate and sampling probability is not possible. The birth-death-sampling process is compared to the sampling-based population genetics model, the coalescent. It is shown that despite many similarities between these two models, the distribution of bifurcation times remains different even in the case of very large population sizes. We illustrate these findings on an Hepatitis C virus dataset from Egypt. We show that the transmission times estimates are significantly different-the widely used Gamma statistic even changes its sign from negative to positive when switching from the coalescent to the birth-death process.},

The {CCR5-[Delta]32} deletion obliterates the {CCR5} chemokine and the human immunodeficiency virus {(HIV)-1} coreceptor on lymphoid cells, leading to strong resistance against {HIV-1} infection and {AIDS.} A genotype survey of 4,166 individuals revealed a cline of {CCR5-[Delta]32} allele frequencies of 0\%-14\% across Eurasia, whereas the variant is absent among native African, American Indian, and East Asian ethnic groups. Haplotype analysis of 192 Caucasian chromosomes revealed strong linkage disequilibrium between {CCR5} and two microsatellite loci. By use of coalescence theory to interpret modern haplotype genealogy, we estimate the origin of the {CCR5-[Delta]32-containing} ancestral haplotype to be {\textasciitilde}700 years ago, with an estimated range of 275-1,875 years. The geographic cline of {CCR5-[Delta]32} frequencies and its recent emergence are consistent with a historic strong selective event (e.g., an epidemic of a pathogen that, like {HIV-1,} utilizes {CCR5),} driving its frequency upward in ancestral Caucasian populations.},

Following a Bayesian approach we show how approximation methods can be applied to design efficient MCMC algorithms with favourable mixing properties for fitting non-Markovian models to partial observations of epidemic processes. The methodology is used to analyse real data concerning a smallpox outbreak in a human population, and a simulation study is conducted to assess the effects of the frequency and accuracy of diagnostic tests on the information yielded on the epidemic process.},

This approach is based on a genealogy inferred from the sequences and provides a nonparametric estimate of effective population size through time. In contrast to previous related procedures, the generalized skyline plot is more applicable to cases where the underlying tree is not fully resolved and the data is not highly variable. This is achieved by the grouping of adjacent coalescent intervals. We employ a small-sample Akaike information criterion to objectively choose the optimal grouping strategy. We investigate the performance of our approach using simulation and subsequently apply it to HIV-1 sequences from central Africa and mtDNA sequences from red pandas.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Statistical phylogenetics is computationally intensive, resulting in considerable attention meted on techniques for parallelization. Codon-based models allow for independent rates of synonymous and replacement substitutions and have the potential to more adequately model the process of protein-coding sequence evolution with a resulting increase in phylogenetic accuracy. Unfortunately, due to the high number of codon states, computational burden has largely thwarted phylogenetic reconstruction under codon models, particularly at the genomic-scale. Here, we describe novel algorithms and methods for evaluating phylogenies under arbitrary molecular evolutionary models on graphics processing units {(GPUs),} making use of the large number of processing cores to efficiently parallelize calculations even for large state-size models. Results: We implement the approach in an existing Bayesian framework and apply the algorithms to estimating the phylogeny of 62 complete mitochondrial genomes of carnivores under a 60-state codon model. We see a near 90-fold speed increase over an optimized {CPU-based} computation and a {\textgreater}140-fold increase over the currently available implementation, making this the first practical use of codon models for phylogenetic inference over whole mitochondrial or microorganism genomes. Availability and implementation: Source code provided in {BEAGLE:} Broad-platform Evolutionary Analysis General Likelihood Evaluator, a cross-platform/processor library for phylogenetic likelihood computation (http://beagle-lib.googlecode.com/).

	Annote = {When multiple strains of viruses with segmented genomes co-infect a single cell, strains with novel genomic constellations may be created. This mutational process, called reassortment, has caused pandemics of influenza A virus in 1957 and 1968. Here a phylogenetic approach to detecting reassortments, which can be used even when the phylogenetic tree constructed for all strains analyzed is unreliable, is presented. A quartet of strains is examined at a time, where a phylogenetic tree is constructed for each genomic segment and the topology is compared among segments only when all quartet trees are supported with a statistical significance. The occurrence of reassortment and the segments involved in the reassortment event are inferred according to the pattern of topological difference among segments. The reassortment point for a pattern is inferred by superimposing the exterior branches of relevant quartet trees on the all-strains trees. In the analysis of {H1N1} and {H3N2} human influenza A viruses, a topological difference was observed for all pairs of genomic segments, suggesting that there is no pair of segments that has always co-segregated in reassortment during the evolutionary history of these viruses. When the reassortment point was inferred for the pattern of topological difference that was supported with the largest number of quartets for each virus, the results appeared to be mostly correct, suggesting that the method was largely reliable.},

	Abstract = {Rates of molecular evolution at some loci are more irregular than described by simple Poisson processes. Three situations under which molecular evolution would not follow simple Poisson processes are reevaluated from the viewpoint of the neutrality hypothesis: concomitant or multiple substitutions in a gene, fluctuating substitution rates in time caused by coupled effects of deleterious mutations and bottlenecks, and changes in the degree of selective constraints against a gene (neutral space) caused by successive substitutions. The common underlying assumption that these causes are lineage nonspecific excludes the case where mutation rates themselves change systematically among lineages or taxonomic groups, and severely limits the extent of variation in the number of substitutions among lineages. Even under this stringent condition, however, the third hypothesis, the fluctuating neutral space model, can generate fairly large variation. This is described by a time-dependent renewal process, which does not exhibit any episodic nature of molecular evolution. It is argued that the observed elevated variances in the number of nucleotide or amino acid substitutions do not immediately call for positive Darwinian selection in molecular evolution.},

	Abstract = {In a geographically structured population, the interplay among gene migration, genetic drift and natural selection raises intriguing evolutionary problems, but the rigorous mathematical treatment is often very difficult. Therefore several approximate formulas were developed concerning the coalescence process of neutral genes and the fixation process of selected mutations in an island model, and their accuracy was examined by computer simulation. When migration is limited, the coalescence (or divergence) time for sampled neutral genes can be described by the convolution of exponential functions, as in a panmictic population, but it is determined mainly by migration rate and the number of demes from which the sample is taken. This time can be much longer than that in a panmictic population with the same number of breeding individuals. For a selected mutation, the spreading over the entire population was formulated as a birth and death process, in which the fixation probability within a deme plays a key role. With limited amounts of migration, even advantageous mutations take a large number of generations to spread. Furthermore, it is likely that these mutations which are temporarily fixed in some demes may be swamped out again by non-mutant immigrants from other demes unless selection is strong enough. These results are potentially useful for testing quantitatively various hypotheses that have been proposed for the origin of modern human populations.},

@article{Takahata:1991vn,
	Abstract = {The most commonly used statistical model to describe the rate constancy of molecular evolution (molecular clock) is a simple Poisson process in which the variance of the number of amino acid or nucleotide substitutions in a particular gene should be equal to the mean and henceforth the dispersion index, the ratio of the variance to the mean, should be equal to one. Recent sequence data, however, have shown that the substitutional process in molecular evolution is often considerably overdispersed and have called into question the generality of using a simple Poisson process. Several efforts have been made to develop more realistic models of molecular evolution. In this paper, I will show that the spatial (site-specific) variation in the rate of molecular evolution is an improbable cause of the overdispersion and then review various statistical models which take the temporal variation into account. Although these models do not immediately specify what the mechanisms of molecular evolution might be, they do make qualitatively different predictions and give some insight into their inference. One way to distinguish them is suggested. In addition, effects of selected substitutions that presumably occur after a major change in a molecule are quasi-quantitatively examined. It is most likely that the overdispersion of molecular clock is due either to a major molecular reconfiguration (fluctuating neutral space) led by a series of subliminal neutral changes or to selected substitutions fine-tuning a molecule after a major molecular change. Although the latter possibility, of course, violates the simplest neutrality assumption, it would not impair the neutral theory as a whole.},

	Abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the molecular epidemiology and genetic structure of {HIV-1s} causing the epidemic in Central Myanmar and to explore the genesis of {HIV} epidemic in this area.
Design: A molecular epidemiological investigation was conducted in 1999-2000 in the city of Mandalay among high-risk populations and the structural features of circulating {HIV-1s} were analyzed.
Methods: {HIV-1} genotypes of 59 specimens were screened based on gag (p17) and env {(C2/V3)} regions. Near full-length nucleotide sequences of {HIV-1} isolates with subtype discordance were determined and their recombinant structures were characterized.
Results: Three lineages of {HIV-1} strains, including {CRF01\_AE} (27, 45.8\%), subtype B' {(Thailand} variant of subtype B) (15, 25.4\%) and subtype C (8, 13.6\%), were distributed in Mandalay, while substantial portions (9, 15.3\%) of specimens showed various patterns of subtype discordance in different regions of {HIV-1} genomes. The study on six {HIV-1} isolates with subtype discordance revealed that they were highly diverse types of unique recombinant forms {(URFs)} comprised of various combinations of three circulating subtypes. One {URF} was a particularly complex mosaic that contained 13 recombination breakpoints between three {HIV-1} subtypes. Approximately half of recombinants showed 'pseudotype' virion structures, in which the external portions of envelope glycoproteins were exchanged with different lineages of {HIV-1} strains, suggesting the potential selective advantage of 'pseudotype' viruses over parental strains.
Conclusion: The study revealed the unique geographical hot spot in Central Myanmar where extensive recombination events appeared to be taking place continually. This reflects the presence of highly exposed individuals and social networks of {HIV-1} transmission.

	Abstract = {Western lowland gorillas {(Gorilla} gorilla gorilla) are infected with a simian immunodeficiency virus {(SIVgor)} that is closely related to chimpanzee and human immunodeficiency viruses {(SIVcpz} and {HIV-1,} respectively) in west central Africa. Although existing data suggest a chimpanzee origin for {SIVgor,} a paucity of available sequences has precluded definitive conclusions. Here, we report the molecular characterization of one partial {(BQ664)} and three full-length {(CP684,} {CP2135,} and {CP2139)} {SIVgor} genomes amplified from fecal {RNAs} of wild-living gorillas at two field sites in Cameroon. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all {SIVgor} strains clustered together, forming a monophyletic lineage throughout their genomes. Interestingly, the closest relatives of {SIVgor} were not {SIVcpzPtt} strains from west central African chimpanzees {(Pan} troglodytes troglodytes) but human viruses belonging to {HIV-1} group O. In trees derived from most genomic regions, {SIVgor} and {HIV-1} group O formed a sister clade to the {SIVcpzPtt} lineage. However, in a tree derived from 5' pol sequences ([{\textasciitilde}]900 bp), {SIVgor} and {HIV-1} group O fell within the {SIVcpzPtt} radiation. The latter was due to two {SIVcpzPtt} strains that contained mosaic pol sequences, pointing to the existence of a divergent {SIVcpzPtt} lineage that gave rise to {SIVgor} and {HIV-1} group O. Gorillas appear to have acquired this lineage at least 100 to 200 years ago. To examine the biological properties of {SIVgor,} we synthesized a full-length provirus from fecal consensus sequences. Transfection of the resulting clone {(CP2139.287)} into {293T} cells yielded infectious virus that replicated efficiently in both human and chimpanzee {CD4+} T cells and used {CCR5} as the coreceptor for viral entry. Together, these results provide strong evidence that P. t. troglodytes apes were the source of {SIVgor.} These same apes may also have spawned the group O epidemic; however, the possibility that gorillas served as an intermediary host cannot be excluded.},

We use an approximate Bayesian computational method in combination with a stochastic model of tuberculosis transmission and mutation of a molecular marker to estimate the net transmission rate, the doubling time, and the reproductive value of the pathogen. This method is applied to a published data set from San Francisco of tuberculosis genotypes based on the marker IS6110. The mutation rate of this marker has previously been studied, and we use those estimates to form a prior distribution of mutation rates in the inference procedure. The posterior point estimates of the key parameters of interest for these data are as follows: net transmission rate, 0.69/year [95\% credibility interval (C.I.) 0.38, 1.08]; doubling time, 1.08 years (95\% C.I. 0.64, 1.82); and reproductive value 3.4 (95\% C.I. 1.4, 79.7). These figures suggest a rapidly spreading epidemic, consistent with observations of the resurgence of tuberculosis in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s.},

	Abstract = {Because recombination between a pair of viral genomes can occur only when both viruses are present in the same host, genealogical evidence of recombination is influenced by the rate of viral migration between infected hosts. If superinfection is rare, then recombining viral genomes will usually be more closely related to each other than to viral genomes present in other hosts and the impact of recombination on the genealogy of a sample of viruses from different hosts may be weak. We used this relationship to estimate the relative rate of intra-subtype HIV-1 superinfection in six urban populations. Comparisons of the population recombination rates estimated from the HIV-1 sequence data with population recombination rates estimated for sets of sequences simulated using a structured coalescent process suggest that intra-subtype superinfection rates in all but one of these populations may be as high as 15\% of the corresponding infection rate. However, we caution that these estimates might be upwardly biased if variation in contact and mixing rates between infected hosts causes viral lineages to be concentrated in groups with higher than average superinfection rates.},

The gag, pol and env genes were analyzed using a combined coalescent and relaxed molecular clock model, implemented in a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo framework.

The recombination event that generated {CRF33\_01B} (trec) occurred sometime between 1991 and 1993, suggesting that recombination is common in the early evolutionary history of {HIV-1.} The proof-of-concept approach provides a new tool for the investigation of {HIV} molecular epidemiology and evolution.},

	Abstract = {Nested clade phylogeographical analysis {(NCPA)} has become a common tool in intraspecific phylogeography. To evaluate the validity of its inferences, {NCPA} was applied to actual data sets with 150 strong a priori expectations, the majority of which had not been analysed previously by {NCPA.} {NCPA} did well overall, but it sometimes failed to detect an expected event and less commonly resulted in a false positive. An examination of these errors suggested some alterations in the {NCPA} inference key, and these modifications reduce the incidence of false positives at the cost of a slight reduction in power. Moreover, {NCPA} does equally well in inferring events regardless of the presence or absence of other, unrelated events. A reanalysis of some recent computer simulations that are seemingly discordant with these results revealed that {NCPA} performed appropriately in these simulated samples and was not prone to a high rate of false positives under sampling assumptions that typify real data sets. {NCPA} makes a posteriori use of an explicit inference key for biological interpretation after statistical hypothesis testing. Alternatives to {NCPA} that claim that biological inference emerges directly from statistical testing are shown in fact to use an a priori inference key, albeit implicitly. It is argued that the a priori and a posteriori approaches to intraspecific phylogeography are complementary, not contradictory. Finally, cross-validation using multiple {DNA} regions is shown to be a powerful method of minimizing inference errors. A likelihood ratio hypothesis testing framework has been developed that allows testing of phylogeographical hypotheses, extends {NCPA} to testing specific hypotheses not within the formal inference key (such as the {out-of-Africa} replacement hypothesis of recent human evolution) and integrates intra- and interspecific phylogeographical inference.},

Here, we use influenza-related mortality data to analyze the between-state progression of interpandemic influenza in the United States over the past 30 years. Outbreaks show hierarchical spatial spread evidenced by higher pairwise synchrony between more populous states. Seasons with higher influenza mortality are associated with higher disease transmission and more rapid spread than are mild ones. The regional spread of infection correlates more closely with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces (workflows) than with geographical distance. Workflows are described in turn by a gravity model, with a rapid decay of commuting up to around 100 km and a long tail of rare longer range flow. A simple epidemiological model, based on the gravity formulation, captures the observed increase of influenza spatial synchrony with transmissibility; high transmission allows influenza to spread rapidly beyond local spatial constraints.},

	Abstract = {The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus lineage has undergone extensive genetic reassortment with viruses from different sources to produce numerous H5N1 genotypes, and also developed into multiple genetically distinct sublineages in China. From there, the virus has spread to over 60 countries. The ecological success of this virus in diverse species of both poultry and wild birds with frequent introduction to humans suggests that it is a likely source of the next human pandemic. Therefore, the evolutionary and ecological characteristics of its emergence from wild birds into poultry are of considerable interest. Here, we apply the latest analytical techniques to infer the early evolutionary dynamics of H5N1 virus in the population from which it emerged (wild birds and domestic poultry). By estimating the time of most recent common ancestors of each gene segment, we show that the H5N1 prototype virus was likely introduced from wild birds into poultry as a non-reassortant low pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus and was not generated by reassortment in poultry. In contrast, more recent H5N1 genotypes were generated locally in aquatic poultry after the prototype virus (A/goose/Guangdong/1/96) introduction occurred, i.e., they were not a result of additional emergence from wild birds. We show that the H5N1 virus was introduced into Indonesia and Vietnam 3-6 months prior to detection of the first outbreaks in those countries. Population dynamics analyses revealed a rapid increase in the genetic diversity of A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 lineage viruses from mid-1999 to early 2000. Our results suggest that the transmission of reassortant viruses through the mixed poultry population in farms and markets in China has selected HPAI H5N1 viruses that are well adapted to multiple hosts and reduced the interspecies transmission barrier of those viruses.},

	Abstract = {We present a formalism for unifying the inference of population size from genetic sequences and mathematical models of infectious disease in populations. Virus phylogenies have been used in many recent studies to infer properties of epidemics. These approaches rely on coalescent models that may not be appropriate for infectious diseases. We account for phylogenetic patterns of viruses in susceptible-infected (SI), susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS), and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models of infectious disease, and our approach may be a viable alternative to demographic models used to reconstruct epidemic dynamics. The method allows epidemiological parameters, such as the reproductive number, to be estimated directly from viral sequence data. We also describe patterns of phylogenetic clustering that are often construed as arising from a short chain of transmissions. Our model reproduces the moments of the distribution of phylogenetic cluster sizes and may therefore serve as a null hypothesis for cluster sizes under simple epidemiological models. We examine a small cross-sectional sample of human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 sequences collected in the United States and compare our results to standard estimates of effective population size. Estimated prevalence is consistent with estimates of effective population size and the known history of the HIV epidemic. While our model accurately estimates prevalence during exponential growth, we find that periods of decline are harder to identify.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical models of transmission have become invaluable management tools in planning for the control of emerging infectious diseases. A key variable in such models is the reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval distribution equal to the observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number.},

	Abstract = {During 1998, severe outbreaks of influenza were observed in four swine herds in the United States. This event was unique because the causative agents, {H3N2} influenza viruses, are infrequently isolated from swine in North America. Two antigenically distinct reassortant viruses {(H3N2)} were isolated from infected animals: a double-reassortant virus containing genes similar to those of human and swine viruses, and a triple-reassortant virus containing genes similar to those of human, swine, and avian influenza viruses {(N.} N. Zhou, D. A. Senne, J. S. Landgraf, S. L. Swenson, G. Erickson, K. Rossow, L. Liu, {K.-J.} Yoon, S. Krauss, and R. G. Webster, J. Virol. 73:8851-8856, 1999). Because the {U.S.} pig population was essentially naive in regard to {H3N2} viruses, it was important to determine the extent of viral spread. Hemagglutination inhibition {(HI)} assays of 4,382 serum samples from swine in 23 states indicated that 28.3\% of these animals had been exposed to classical swine-like {H1N1} viruses and 20.5\% had been exposed to the triple-reassortant-like {H3N2} viruses. The {HI} data suggested that viruses antigenically related to the double-reassortant {H3N2} virus have not become widespread in the {U.S.} swine population. The seroreactivity levels in swine serum samples and the nucleotide sequences of six additional 1999 isolates, all of which were of the triple-reassortant genotype, suggested that {H3N2} viruses containing avian {PA} and {PB2} genes had spread throughout much of the country. These avian-like genes cluster with genes from North American avian viruses. The worldwide predominance of swine viruses containing an avian-like internal gene component suggests that these genes may confer a selective advantage in pigs. Analysis of the 1999 swine {H3N2} isolates showed that the internal gene complex of the triple-reassortant viruses was associated with three recent phylogenetically distinct human-like hemagglutinin {(HA)} molecules. Acquisition of {HA} genes from the human virus reservoir will significantly affect the efficacy of the current swine {H3N2} vaccines. This finding supports continued surveillance of {U.S.} swine populations for influenza virus activity.},

	Abstract = {In 1977, {H1N1} influenza A virus reappeared after a 20-year absence. Genetic analysis indicated that this strain was missing decades of nucleotide sequence evolution, suggesting an accidental release of a frozen laboratory strain into the general population. Recently, this strain and its descendants were included in an analysis attempting to date the origin of pandemic influenza virus without accounting for the missing decades of evolution. Here, we investigated the effect of using viral isolates with biologically unrealistic sampling dates on estimates of divergence dates. Not accounting for missing sequence evolution produced biased results and increased the variance of date estimates of the most recent common ancestor of the re-emergent lineages and across the entire phylogeny. Reanalysis of the {H1N1} sequences excluding isolates with unrealistic sampling dates indicates that the 1977 re-emergent lineage was circulating for approximately one year before detection, making it difficult to determine the geographic source of reintroduction. We suggest that a new method is needed to account for viral isolates with unrealistic sampling dates.},

	Abstract = {While the circumstances surrounding the origin and spread of {HIV} are becoming clearer, the particulars of the origin of simian immunodeficiency virus {(SIV)} are still unknown. Specifically, the age of {SIV,} whether it is an ancient or recent infection, has not been resolved. Although many instances of cross-species transmission of {SIV} have been documented, the similarity between the African green monkey {(AGM)} and {SIVagm} phylogenies has long been held as suggestive of ancient codivergence between {SIVs} and their primate hosts. Here, we present well-resolved phylogenies based on full-length {AGM} mitochondrial genomes and seven previously published {SIVagm} genomes; these allowed us to perform the first rigorous phylogenetic test to our knowledge of the hypothesis that {SIVagm} codiverged with the {AGMs.} Using the {Shimodaira--Hasegawa} test, we show that the {AGM} mitochondrial genomes and {SIVagm} did not evolve along the same topology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the {SIVagm} topology can be explained by a pattern of west-to-east transmission of the virus across existing {AGM} geographic ranges. Using a relaxed molecular clock, we also provide a date for the most recent common ancestor of the {AGMs} at approximately 3 million years ago. This study substantially weakens the theory of ancient {SIV} infection followed by codivergence with its primate hosts.},

@article{wertheim:2009da,
	Abstract = {{HIV/AIDS} continues to be a major health problem worldwide. An understanding of the evolution of {HIV} in humans may be greatly improved by detailed knowledge of its predecessor, simian immunodeficiency virus {(SIV),} in non-human primates. While {HIV} causes {AIDS} in humans, {SIV} generally produces a benign infection in its natural hosts. This avirulence is often attributed to coevolution between the virus and its host, possibly due to codivergence over millions of years. Here, we provide a temporal reference for evolution of {SIV} in its natural primate hosts. Using state-of-the-art molecular clock dating techniques, we estimate the time of most recent common ancestor for {SIV} in sooty mangabeys and chimpanzees at 1809 (1729{\^a}€``1875) and 1492 (1266{\^a}€``1685), respectively. These ages indicate that {SIV} may have infected these natural hosts for only hundreds of years before giving rise to {HIV.} This short duration suggests that viral{\^a}€``host coevolution over millions of years is not a likely explanation for the widespread avirulence of {SIV.} Finally, despite differences between {SIV} and {HIV} in host biology and viral pathogenicity, we have found clear and direct evidence that {SIV} evolves at a rapid rate in its natural hosts, an evolutionary rate that is indistinguishable from that of {HIV} in humans.},

	Abstract = {Simian immunodeficiency virus {(SIV)} lineages have been identified that are endemic to Bioko Island. The time the island formed offers a geological time scale calibration point for dating the most recent common ancestor of {SIV.} The Bioko viruses cover the whole range of {SIV} genetic diversity, and each Bioko {SIV} clade is most closely related to viruses circulating in hosts of the same genus on the African mainland rather than to {SIVs} of other Bioko species. Our phylogeographic approach establishes that {SIV} is ancient and at least 32,000 years old. Our conservative calibration point and analyses of gene sequence saturation and dating bias suggest it may be much older.},

	Abstract = {Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory disease caused by a zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) named SARS-CoV (SCoV), which rapidly swept the globe after its emergence in rural China during late 2002. The origins of SCoV have been mysterious and controversial, until the recent discovery of SARS-like CoV (SLCoV) in bats and the proposal of bats as the natural reservior of the Coronaviridae family. In this article, we focused on discussing how phylogenetics contributed to our understanding towards the emergence and transmission of SCoV. We first reviewed the epidemiology of SCoV from a phylogenetic perspective and discussed the controversies over its phylogenetic origins. Then, we summarized the phylogenetic findings in relation to its zoonotic origins and the proposed inter-species viral transmission events. Finally, we also discussed how the discoveries of SCoV and SLCoV expanded our knowledge on the evolution of the Coronaviridae family as well as its implications on the possible future re-emergence of SCoV.},

	Abstract = {Although single-species deterministic difference equations have long
	been used in modeling the dynamics of animal populations, little
	attention has been paid to how stochasticity should be incorporated
	into these models. By deriving stochastic analogues to difference
	equations from first principles, we show that the form of these models
	depends on whether noise in the population process is demographic
	or environmental. When noise is demographic, we argue that variance
	around the expectation is proportional to the expectation. When noise
	is environmental the variance depends in a non-trivial way on how
	variation enters into model parameters, but we argue that if the
	environment affects the population multiplicatively then variance
	is proportional to the square of the expectation. We compare various
	stochastic analogues of the Ricker map model by fitting them, using
	maximum likelihood estimation, to data generated from an individual-based
	model and the weevil data of Utida. Our demographic models are significantly
	better than our environmental models at fitting noise generated by
	population processes where noise is mainly demographic. However,
	the traditionally chosen stochastic analogues to deterministic models--additive
	normally distributed noise and multiplicative lognormally distributed
	noise--generally fit all data sets well. Thus, the form of the variance
	does play a role in the fitting of models to ecological time series,
	but may not be important in practice as first supposed.},

	Abstract = {We consider a range of models that may be used to predict the future
	persistence of populations, particularly those based on discrete-state
	Markov processes. While the mathematical theory of such processes
	is very well-developed, they may be difficult to work with when attempting
	to estimate parameters or expected times to extinction. Hence, we
	focus on diffusion and other approximations to these models, presenting
	new and recent developments in parameter estimation for density dependent
	processes, and the calculation of extinction times for processes
	subject to catastrophes. We illustrate these and other methods using
	data from simulated and real time series. We give particular attention
	to a procedure, due to Ross et al. [Ross, J.V., Taimre, T., Pollett,
	P.K. On parameter estimation in population models, Theor. Popul.
	Biol., in press], for estimating the parameters of the stochastic
	SIS logistic model, and demonstrate ways in which these parameters
	may be used to estimate expected extinction times. Although the stochastic
	SIS logistic model is strictly density dependent and allows only
	for birth and death events, it nonetheless may be used to predict
	extinction times with some accuracy even for populations that are
	only weakly density dependent, or that are subject to catastrophes.

	confirmation, is that the magnitude of fluctuations in population
	densities due to demographic stochasticity scales inversely with
	the square root of population numbers. This supposition is based
	on analyses of models exhibiting exponential growth or stable equilibria.
	Using two quantitative measures, we extend the scaling rule to situations
	in which population densities fluctuate due to nonlinear deterministic
	dynamics. These measures are applied to populations of the flour
	beetle Tribolium castaneum that display chaotic dynamics in both
	20-g and 60-g habitats. Populations cultured in the larger habitat
	exhibit a clarification of the deterministic dynamics, which follows
	the inverse square root rule. Lattice effects, a deterministic phenomenon
	caused by the discrete nature of individuals, can cause deviations
	from the scaling rule when population numbers are small. The scaling
	rule is robust to the probability distribution used to model demographic
	variation among individuals.},

	Abstract = {Predicting population extinctions is a key element of quantitative
	conservation biology and population ecology. Although stochastic
	population theories have long been used to obtain theoretical distributions
	of population extinction times, model-based predictions have rarely
	been tested. Here I report results from a quantitative analysis of
	extinction time in 281 experimental populations of water fleas (Daphnia
	magna) in variable environments. To my knowledge, this is the first
	quantitative estimate of the shape of the distribution of population
	extinction times based on extinction data for any species. The finding
	that the distribution of population extinction times was extraordinarily
	peaked is consistent with theoretical predictions for density-independent
	populations, but inconsistent with predictions for density-dependent
	populations. The tail of the extinction time distribution was not
	exponential. These results imply that our current theories of extinction
	are inadequate. Future work should focus on how demographic stochasticity
	scales with population size and effects of nonrandom variable environments
	on population growth and decline.},

	of individual species. The model has also been used to study persistence
	in simple disease models. The stochastic logistic model has direct
	relevance for questions of limiting similarity in ecological systems.
	This paper uses a biased random walk heuristic to derive a scaling
	relationship for the persistence of a population under this model,
	and discusses its implications for models of biodiversity and persistence.
	Time to extinction of a species under the stochastic logistic model
	is approximated by the exponential of the scaling quantity U=(R-1)(2)
	N/R(R+1), where N is the habitat size and R is the basic reproductive

	Abstract = {We derive formulas that can be applied to estimate the effective population
	size N(e) for organisms with two sexes reproducing once a year and
	having constant adult mean vital rates independent of age. Temporal
	fluctuations in population size are generated by demographic and
	environmental stochasticity. For populations with even sex ratio
	at birth, no deterministic population growth and identical mean vital
	rates for both sexes, the key parameter determining N(e) is simply
	the mean value of the demographic variance for males and females
	considered separately. In this case Crow and Kimura's generalization
	of Wright's formula for N(e) with two sexes, in terms of the effective
	population sizes for each sex, is applicable even for fluctuating
	populations with different stochasticity in vital rates for males
	and females. If the mean vital rates are different for the sexes
	then a simple linear combination of the demographic variances determines
	N(e), further extending Wright's formula. For long-lived species
	an expression is derived for N(e) involving the generation times
	for both sexes. In the general case with nonzero population growth
	and uneven sex ratio of newborns, we use the model to investigate
	numerically the effects of different population parameters on N(e).
	We also estimate the ratio of effective to actual population size
	in six populations of house sparrows on islands off the coast of
	northern Norway. This ratio showed large interisland variation because
	of demographic differences among the populations. Finally, we calculate
	how N(e) in a growing house sparrow population will change over time.},

	occur when the population size reaches some given lower density.
	If this density is chosen to be large enough for the demographic
	stochasticity to be ignored compared to environmental stochasticity,

	mixture is used to predict the population size at a finite time for
	the same process provided that quasi-extinction has not occurred
	before that time. Stochastic simulations indicate that the coverage

@article{FOLEY2000,
	Abstract = {It is a vexing problem to achieve a consensus about the proper scientific
	way to assess population viability for habitat conservation plans.
	Rather than a hypothesis-testing approach, here it is proposed to
	select population models, estimate extinction parameters, and assess
	prediction uncertainty using a pragmatic, empirical Bayesian approach.
	The simplest usable models include the effects of population growth,
	r; carrying capacity, K; Allee threshold, N(A); and environmental
	stochasticity, v(r). Analytic predictions of expected extinction
	times are available for such models. Models that are more complex
	can be elaborated from this basis. Selection from a hierarchy of
	nesting population models can often be done through the evaluation
	of parameters. The estimation of the most important extinction parameters
	can be undertaken in a variety of ways. Time series can be analyzed
	to estimate r(d), v(r), rho, and K. Habitat models and individualistic
	population models may help estimate N(A) and K and demographic stochasticity.
	Fine-scale biogeography and climatological data may be useful in
	the estimation of a variety of parameters. Because it takes many
	years to estimate extinction parameters accurately for a given population
	of interest, the most efficient estimation procedures are desirable.
	I propose the use of prior information from an (as yet nonexistent)
	population biology database. The accumulation of local information
	through monitoring will improve our estimates allowing adaptive management.
	Uncertainty in the estimates will always remain, but it may be quantified
	by the posterior distributions. A crude example is discussed using
	treefrog population data. Although the motivations, beliefs, and
	biases of competing stakeholders will differ, a habitat conservation
	plan could accommodate this variation in the prior distributions.
	Field experience from monitoring will increasingly clear up any discrepancies
	between the opposing beliefs and the real ecosystem. As the world
	is an uncertain place and because there is no universal scientific
	method, there will always be controversy and surprises. The best
	we can do is (1) agree about our prior information, (2) agree about
	the strategy of model selection and parameter estimation, and (3)
	agree about our strategy for adaptive management. Perhaps the greatest
	impediment to such prior agreements for HCPs is the likely paranoia
	inspired by the use of unfamiliar statistical methodology. We need
	to train students of ecology in a more flexible and deeper understanding
	of statistics and philosophy of science.},

@article{Foley1994,
	Abstract = {Managers of small populations often need to estimate the expected
	time to extinction T(e) of their charges. Useful models for extinction
	times must be ecologically realistic and depend on measurable parameters.
	Many populations become extinct due to environmental stochasticity,
	even when the carrying capacity K is stable and the expected growth
	rate is positive. A model is proposed that gives T(e) by diffusion
	analysis of the log population size n(t) (= log(e) N(t)). The model
	population grows according to the equation N(t+1) = R(t)N(t), with
	K as a ceiling. Application of the model requires estimation of the
	parameters k = logK, r(d) = the expected change in n, v(r) = Variance(log
	R), and rho the autocorrelation of the r(t). These are readily calculable
	from annual census data (r(d) is trickiest to estimate). General
	formulas for T(e) are derived. As a special case, when environmental
	fluctuations overwhelm expected growth (that is r(d) almost-equal-to
	0), T(e) = 2n0(k - n0/2)/v(r). If the r(t) are autocorrelated, then
	the effective variance is v(re) almost-equal-to v(r) (1 + rho)/(1
	- rho). The theory is applied to populations of checkerspot butterfly,
	grizzly bear, wolf and mountain lion.},

	Abstract = {Environmental threats, such as habitat size reduction or environmental
	pollution, may not cause immediate extinction of a population but
	shorten the expected time to extinction. We develop a method to estimate
	the mean time to extinction for a density-dependent population with
	environmental fluctuation. We first derive a formula for a stochastic
	differential equation model (canonical model) of a population with
	logistic growth with environmental and demographic stochasticities.
	We then study an approximate maximum likelihood (AML) estimate of
	three parameters (intrinsic growth rate r, carrying capacity K, and
	environmental stochasticity sigma(2)(e)) from a time series of population
	size. The AML estimate of r has a significant bias, but by adopting
	the Monte Carlo method, we can remove the bias very effectively (bias-corrected
	estimate). We can also determine the confidence interval of the parameter
	based on the Monte Carlo method. If the length of the time series
	is moderately long (with 40-50 data points), parameter estimation
	with the Monte Carlo sampling bias correction has a relatively small
	variance. However, if the time series is short (less than or equal
	to 10 data points), the estimate has a large variance and is not
	reliable. If we know the intrinsic growth rate r, however, the estimate
	of K and sigma(2)(e)and the mean extinction time T are reliable even
	if only a short time series is available. We illustrate the method
	using data for a freshwater fish, Japanese crucian carp (Carassius
	auratus subsp.) in Lake Biwa, in which the growth rate and environmental
	noise of crucian carp are estimated using fishery records.},

	Abstract = {Seasonal oscillations in birth rates are ubiquitous in human populations.
	These oscillations might play an important role in infectious disease
	dynamics because they induce seasonal variation in the number of
	susceptible individuals that enter populations. We incorporate seasonality
	of birth rate into the standard, deterministic susceptible-infectious-recovered
	(SIR) and susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemic
	models and identify parameter regions in which birth seasonality
	can be expected to have observable epidemiological effects. The SIR
	and SEIR models yield similar results if the infectious period in
	the SIR model is compared with the infected period (the sum of the
	latent and infectious periods) in the SEIR model. For extremely transmissible
	pathogens, large amplitude birth seasonality can induce resonant
	oscillations in disease incidence, bifurcations to stable multi-year
	epidemic cycles, and hysteresis. Typical childhood infectious diseases
	are not sufficiently transmissible for their asymptotic dynamics
	to be likely to exhibit such behaviour. However, we show that fold
	and period-doubling bifurcations generically occur within regions
	of parameter space where transients are phase-locked onto cycles
	resembling the limit cycles beyond the bifurcations, and that these
	phase-locking regions extend to arbitrarily small amplitude of seasonality
	of birth rates. Consequently, significant epidemiological effects
	of birth seasonality may occur in practice in the form of transient
	dynamics that are sustained by demographic stochasticity.},

	Abstract = {This article develops a theoretical framework to link dynamical and
	population genetic models of persistent viral infection. This linkage
	is useful because, while the dynamical and population genetic theories
	have developed independently, the biological processes they describe
	are completely interrelated. Parameters of the dynamical models are
	important determinants of evolutionary processes such as natural
	selection and genetic drift. We develop analytical methods, based
	on coupled differential equations and Markov chain theory, to predict
	the accumulation of genetic diversity within the viral population
	as a function of dynamical parameters. These methods are first applied
	to the standard model of viral dynamics and then generalized to consider
	the infection of multiple host cell types by the viral population.
	Each cell type is characterized by specific parameter values. Inclusion
	of multiple cell types increases the likelihood of persistent infection
	and can increase the amount of genetic diversity within the viral
	population. However, the overall rate of gene sequence evolution
	may actually be reduced.},

@article{Kolzsch2007,
	Abstract = {1. During the last centuries, the breeding range of the great snipe
	Gallinago media has declined dramatically in the western part of
	its distribution. To examine present population dynamics in the Scandinavian
	mountains, we collected and analysed a 19-year time series of counts
	of great snipe males at leks in central Norway, 1987-2005. 2. The
	population showed large annual fluctuations in the number of males
	displaying at lek sites (range 45-90 males at the peak of the mating
	season), but no overall trend. 3. We detected presence of direct
	density-dependent mechanisms regulating this population. Inclusion
	of the density-dependent term in a Ricker-type model significantly
	improved the fit with observed data (evaluated with Parametric Bootstrap
	Likelihood Ratio tests and Akaike's Information Criterion for small
	sample size). 4. An analysis of (a number of a priori likely) environmental
	covariates suggests that the population dynamics were affected by
	conditions influencing reproduction and survival of offspring during
	the summer, but not by conditions influencing survival at the wintering
	grounds in Africa. This is in contrast to many altricial birds breeding
	in the northern hemisphere, and supports the idea that population
	dynamics of migratory nidifugous birds are more influenced by conditions
	during reproduction. 5. Inclusion of these external factors into
	our model improved the detectability of density dependence. This
	illustrates that allowing for external effects may increase statistical
	power of density dependence tests and thus be of particular importance
	in relatively short time series. 6. In our best model of the population
	dynamics, two likely density-independent offspring survival covariates
	explained 47.3% of the variance in great snipe numbers (predation
	pressure estimated by willow grouse reproductive success and food
	availability estimated by the amount of precipitation in June), whereas
	density dependence explained 35.5%. Demographic stochasticity and
	unidentified environmental stochasticity may account for the remaining
	17.2%.},

	Abstract = {We link two-allele population models by Haldane and Fisher with Kimura's
	diffusion approximations of the Wright-Fisher model, by considering
	continuous-state branching (CB) processes which are either independent
	(model I) or conditioned to have constant sum (model II). Recent
	works by the author allow us to further include logistic density-dependence
	(model III), which is ubiquitous in ecology. In all models, each
	allele (mutant or resident) is then characterized by a triple demographic
	trait: intrinsic growth rate r, reproduction variance sigma and competition
	sensitivity c. Generally, the fixation probability u of the mutant
	depends on its initial proportion p, the total initial population
	size z, and the six demographic traits. Under weak selection, we
	can linearize u in all models thanks to the same master formula u
	= p + p(1-p )g(r)s(r) + g(sigma)s(sigma) + g(c)s(c) + o(s(r), s(sigma)
	s(c)), where s(r) = r' - r, s(sigma) = sigma - sigma' and s(c) =
	c - c' are selection coefficients, and g(r), g(sigma), g(c) are invasibility
	coefficients (' refers to the mutant traits), which are positive
	and do not depend on p. In particular, increased reproduction variance
	is always deleterious. We prove that in all three models g(sigma)
	= 1/sigma and g(r) = z/sigma for small initial population sizes z.
	In model II, g(r) = z/sigma for all z, and we display invasion isoclines
	of the 'mean vs variance' type. A slight departure from the isocline
	is shown to be more beneficial to alleles with low u than with high
	r. In model III, g(c) increases with z like ln(z)/c, and g(r)(Z)
	converges to a finite limit L > K/sigma, where K = r/c is the carrying
	capacity. For r > 0 the growth invasibility is above z/sigma when
	z < K, and below z/sigma when z > K, showing that classical models
	I and II underestimate the fixation probabilities in growing populations,
	and overestimate them in declining populations. (c) 2006 Elsevier

@article{Lambert2005,
	Abstract = {In order to model random density-dependence in population dynamics,
	we construct the random analogue of the well-known logistic process
	in the branching process' framework. This density-dependence corresponds
	to intraspecific competition pressure, which is ubiquitous in ecology,
	and translates mathematically into a quadratic death rate. The logistic
	branching process, or LB-process, can thus be seen as (the mass of)
	a fragmentation process (corresponding to the branching mechanism)
	combined with constant coagulation rate (the death rate is proportional
	to the number of possible coalescing pairs). In the continuous state-space
	setting, the LB-process is a time-changed (in Lamperti's fashion)
	Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type process. We obtain similar results for both
	constructions: when natural deaths do not occur, the LB-process converges
	to a specified distribution; otherwise, it goes extinct a.s. In the
	latter case, we provide the expectation and the Laplace transform
	of the absorption time, as a functional of the solution of a Riccati
	differential equation. We also show that the quadratic regulatory
	term allows the LB-process to start at infinity, despite the fact
	that births occur infinitely often as the initial state goes to \&INFIN;.
	This result can be viewed as an extension of the pure-death process
	starting from infinity associated to Kingman's coalescent, when some
	independent fragmentation is added.},

@article{Lande1993,
	Abstract = {Stochastic factors affecting the demography of a single population
	are analyzed to determine the relative risks of extinction from demographic
	stochasticity, environmental stochasticity, and random catastrophes.
	Relative risks are assessed by comparing asymptotic scaling relationships
	describing how the average time to extinction, T, increases with
	the carrying capacity of a population, K, under each stochastic factor
	alone. Stochastic factors are added to a simple model of exponential
	growth up to K. A critical parameter affecting the extinction dynamics
	is r, the long-run growth rate of a population below K, including
	stochastic factors. If r is positive, with demographic stochasticity
	T increases asymptotically as a nearly exponential function of K,
	and with either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes
	T increases asymptotically as a power of K. If r is negative, under
	any stochastic demographic factor, T increases asymptotically with
	the logarithm of K. Thus, for sufficiently large populations, the
	risk of extinction from demographic stochasticity is less important
	than that from either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes.
	The relative risks of extinction from environmental stochasticity
	and random catastrophes depend on the mean and environmental variance
	of population growth rate, and the magnitude and frequency of catastrophes.
	Contrary to previous assertions in the literature, a population of
	modest size subject to environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes
	can persist for a long time, if r is substantially positive.},

	Abstract = {The major role played by demographic stochasticity in determining
	the dynamics and persistence of childhood diseases, such as measles,
	chickenpox and pertussis, has long been realized. Techniques which
	can be used to estimate the magnitude of this stochastic effect are
	of clear importance. In this study, we assess and compare the use
	of two moment closure approximations to estimate the variability
	seen about the average behavior of stochastic models for the recurrent
	epidemics seen in childhood diseases. The performance of the approximations
	are assessed using analytic techniques available for the simplest
	epidemiological model and using numerical simulations in more complex
	settings. We also present epidemiologically important extensions
	of previous work, considering variability in the SEIR model and in
	situations for which there is seasonal variation in disease transmission.
	Important implications of stochastic effects for the dynamics of
	childhood diseases are highlighted, including serious deficiencies
	of deterministic descriptions of dynamical behavior.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops a stochastic logistic population growth model
	with immigration and multiple births. The differential equations
	for the low-order cumulant functions (i.e., mean, variance, and skewness)
	of the single birth model are reviewed, and the corresponding equations
	for the multiple birth model are derived. Accurate approximate solutions
	for the cumulant functions are obtained using moment closure methods
	for two families of model parameterizations, one for badger and the
	other for fox population growth. For both model families, the equilibrium
	size distribution may be approximated well using the Normal approximation,
	and even more accurately using the saddlepoint approximation. It
	is shown that in comparison with the corresponding single birth model,
	the multiple birth mechanism increases the skewness and the variance
	of the equilibrium distribution, but slightly reduces its mean. Moreover,
	the type of density-dependent population control is shown to influence
	the sign of the skewness and the size of the variance.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the statistics of extinction times for an isolated
	population, with an initially modest number M of individuals, whose
	dynamics are controlled by a stochastic logistic process (SLP). The
	coefficient of variation in the extinction time V is found to have
	a maximum value when the death and birth rates are close in value.
	For large habitat size K we find that Vmax is of order K1/4 / M1/2,
	which is much larger than unity so long as M is small compared to
	K1/2. We also present a study of the SLP using the moment closure
	approximation (MCA), and discuss the successes and failures of this
	method. Regarding the former, the MCA yields a steady-state distribution
	for the population when the death rate is low. Although not correct
	for the SLP model, the first three moments of this distribution coincide
	with those calculated exactly for an adjusted SLP in which extinction
	is forbidden. These exact calculations also pinpoint the breakdown
	of the MCA as the death rate is increased.},

@article{Parsons2007,
	Abstract = {We extend the one-locus two allele Moran model of fixation in a haploid
	population to the case where the total size of the population is
	not fixed. The model is defined as a two-dimensional birth-and-death
	process for allele number. Changes in allele number occur through
	density-independent death events and birth events whose per capita
	rate decreases linearly with the total population density. Uniquely
	for models of this type, the latter is determined by these same birth-and-death
	events. This provides a framework for investigating both the effects
	of fluctuation in total population number through demographic stochasticity,
	and deterministic density-dependent changes in mean density, on allele
	fixation. We analyze this model using a combination of asymptotic
	analytic approximations supported by numerics. We find that for advantageous
	mutants demographic stochasticity of the resident population does
	not affect the fixation probability, but that deterministic changes
	in total density do. In contrast, for deleterious mutants, the fixation
	probability increases with increasing resident population fluctuation
	size, but is relatively insensitive to initial density. These phenomena
	cannot be described by simply using a harmonic mean effective population
	size.},

@article{Ren2008,
	Abstract = {Supermatrix and supertree methods are two strategies advocated for
	phylogenetic analysis of sequence data from multiple gene loci, especially
	when some species are missing at some loci. The supermatrix method
	concatenates sequences from multiple genes into a data supermatrix
	for phylogenetic analysis, and ignores differences in evolutionary
	dynamics among the genes. The supertree method analyzes each gene
	separately and assembles the subtrees estimated from individual genes
	into a supertree for all species. Most algorithms suggested for supertree
	construction lack statistical justifications and ignore uncertainties
	in the subtrees. Instead of supermatrix or supertree, we advocate
	the use of likelihood function to combine data from multiple genes
	while accommodating their differences in the evolutionary process.
	This combines the strengths of the supermatrix and supertree methods
	while avoiding their drawbacks. We conduct computer simulation to
	evaluate the performance of the supermatrix, supertree, and maximum
	likelihood methods applied to two phylogenetic problems: molecular-clock
	dating of species divergences and reconstruction of species phylogenies.
	The results confirm the theoretical superiority of the likelihood
	method. Supertree or separate analyses of data of multiple genes
	may be useful in revealing the characteristics of the evolutionary
	process of multiple gene loci, and the information may be used to
	formulate realistic models for combined analysis of all genes by
	likelihood.},

@article{Lewis:2005bv,
	Abstract = {Bayesian phylogenetic analyses are now very popular in systematics and molecular evolution because they allow the use of much more realistic models than currently possible with maximum likelihood methods. There are, however, a growing number of examples in which large Bayesian posterior clade probabilities are associated with very short branch lengths and low values for non-Bayesian measures of support such as nonparametric bootstrapping. For the four-taxon case when the true tree is the star phylogeny, Bayesian analyses become increasingly unpredictable in their preference for one of the three possible resolved tree topologies as data set size increases. This leads to the prediction that hard (or near-hard) polytomies in nature will cause unpredictable behavior in Bayesian analyses, with arbitrary resolutions of the polytomy receiving very high posterior probabilities in some cases. We present a simple solution to this problem involving a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that allows exploration of all of tree space, including unresolved tree topologies with one or more polytomies. The reversible-jump MCMC approach allows prior distributions to place some weight on less-resolved tree topologies, which eliminates misleadingly high posteriors associated with arbitrary resolutions of hard polytomies. Fortunately, assigning some prior probability to polytomous tree topologies does not appear to come with a significant cost in terms of the ability to assess the level of support for edges that do exist in the true tree. Methods are discussed for applying arbitrary prior distributions to tree topologies of varying resolution, and an empirical example showing evidence of polytomies is analyzed and discussed.},

In contrast, widely used methods for estimating divergence times from molecular sequence data assume constancy of rates. Therefore, methods for estimation of divergence times that incorporate rate variation are attractive. Improvements on a previously proposed Bayesian technique for divergence time estimation are described. New parameterization more effectively captures the phylogenetic structure of rate evolution on a tree. Fossil information and other evidence can now be included in Bayesian analyses in the form of constraints on divergence times. Simulation results demonstrate that the accuracy of divergence time estimation is substantially enhanced when constraints are included.},

The method uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to investigate possible genealogies with branch lengths and with migration events. Properties of the new method are shown by using simulated data from a four-population n-island model and a source-sink population model. Our estimation method as coded in migrate is tested against genetree; both programs deliver a very similar likelihood surface. The algorithm converges to the estimates fairly quickly, even when the Markov chain is started from unfavorable parameters.

@article{Beerli:2006pi,
	Abstract = {Comparison of the performance and accuracy of different inference methods, such as maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference, is difficult because the inference methods are implemented in different programs, often written by different authors. Both methods were implemented in the program MIGRATE, that estimates population genetic parameters, such as population sizes and migration rates, using coalescence theory. Both inference methods use the same Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and differ from each other in only two aspects: parameter proposal distribution and maximization of the likelihood function. Using simulated datasets, the Bayesian method generally fares better than the ML approach in accuracy and coverage, although for some values the two approaches are equal in performance. MOTIVATION: The Markov chain Monte Carlo-based ML framework can fail on sparse data and can deliver non-conservative support intervals. A Bayesian framework with appropriate prior distribution is able to remedy some of these problems. RESULTS: The program MIGRATE was extended to allow not only for ML(-) maximum likelihood estimation of population genetics parameters but also for using a Bayesian framework. Comparisons between the Bayesian approach and the ML approach are facilitated because both modes estimate the same parameters under the same population model and assumptions.},

The programs may be used to compare and test phylogenetic trees, but their main strengths lie in the rich repertoire of evolutionary models implemented, which can be used to estimate parameters in models of sequence evolution and to test interesting biological hypotheses. Uses of the programs include estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates (d(N) and d(S)) between two protein-coding DNA sequences, inference of positive Darwinian selection through phylogenetic comparison of protein-coding genes, reconstruction of ancestral genes and proteins for molecular restoration studies of extinct life forms, combined analysis of heterogeneous data sets from multiple gene loci, and estimation of species divergence times incorporating uncertainties in fossil calibrations. This note discusses some of the major applications of the package, which includes example data sets to demonstrate their use.

	Abstract = {It is frequently true that molecular sequences do not evolve in a strictly clocklike manner. Instead, substitution rate may vary for a number of reasons, including changes in selection pressure and effective population size, as well as changes in mean generation time. Here we present two new methods for estimating stepwise changes in substitution rates when serially sampled molecular sequences are available. These methods are based on multiple rates with dated tips (MRDT) models and allow different rates to be estimated for different intervals of time. These intervals may correspond to the sampling intervals or to a priori--defined intervals that are not coincident with the times the serial samples are obtained. Two methods for obtaining estimates of multiple rates are described. The first is an extension of the phylogeny-based maximum-likelihood estimation procedure introduced by Rambaut. The second is a new parameterization of the pairwise distance least-squares procedure used by Drummond and Rodrigo. The utility of these methods is demonstrated on a genealogy of HIV sequences obtained at five different sampling times from a single patient over a period of 34 months.},

	Abstract = {Within the large body of research on retroviruses, the distribution and evolution of endemic retroviruses in natural host populations have so far received little attention. In this study, the epidemiology, genetic diversity, and molecular evolution of feline immunodeficiency virus specific to cougars (FIVpco) was examined using blood samples collected over several years from a free-ranging cougar population in the western United States. The virus prevalence was 58% in this population (n = 52) and increased significantly with host age. Based on phylogenetic analysis of fragments of envelope (env) and polymerase (pol) genes, two genetically distinct lineages of FIVpco were found to cooccur in the population but not in the same individuals. Within each of the virus lineages, geographically nearby isolates formed monophyletic clusters of closely related viruses. Sequence diversity for env within a host rarely exceeded 1%, and the evolution of this gene was dominated by purifying selection. For both pol and env, our data indicate mean rates of molecular evolution of 1 to 3% per 10 years. These results support the premise that FIVpco is well adapted to its cougar host and provide a basis for comparing lentivirus evolution in endemic and epidemic infections in natural hosts.},

In this paper, we extend these analyzes to allow the estimation of a joint rate of substitution, omega, from several evolving populations from which serial samples are drawn. In the case of viruses evolving in different hosts, therapy may halt replication and therefore the accumulation of substitutions in the population. In such cases, it may be that only a proportion, p, of subjects are nonresponders who have viral populations that continue to evolve. We develop two likelihood-based procedures to jointly estimate p and omega, and empirical Bayes' tests of whether an individual should be classified as a responder or nonresponder.

	Abstract = {The ratite moa (Aves; Dinornithiformes) were massive graviportal browsers weighing up to 250 kg (ref. 1) that dominated the New Zealand biota until their extinction approximately 500 yr ago. Despite an extensive Quaternary fossil record, moa taxonomy remains problematic and currently 11 species are recognized. Three Dinornis species were found throughout New Zealand and differed markedly in size (1-2 m height at back) and mass (from approximately 34 to 242 kg). Surprisingly, ancient mitochondrial DNA sequences show that the three species were genetically indistinguishable within each island, but formed separate North and South Island clades. Here we show, using the first sex-linked nuclear sequences from an extinct species, that on each island the three morphological forms actually represent just one species, whose size varied markedly according to sex and habitat. The largest females in this example of extreme reversed sexual size dimorphism were about 280% the weight and 150% the height of the largest males, which is unprecedented among birds and terrestrial mammals. The combination of molecular and palaeontological data highlights the difficulties of analysing extinct groups, even those with detailed fossil records.},

@article{Drummond2003inference,
	Abstract = {The processes of mutation and nucleotide substitution contribute to the observed variability in virulence, transmission and persistence of viral pathogens. Since most viruses evolve many times faster than their human hosts, we are in the unusual position of being able to measure these processes directly by comparing viral genes that have been isolated and sequenced at different points in time. The analysis of such data requires the use of specific statistical methods that take into account the shared ancestry of the sequences and the randomness inherent in the process of nucleotide substitution. In this paper we describe the various statistical methods for estimating evolutionary rates, which can be classified into three general approaches: linear regression, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. We discuss the advantages and shortcomings of each approach and illustrate their use through the analysis of two example viruses; human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and dengue virus serotype 4. Reliable estimates of viral substitution rates have many important applications in population genetics and phylogenetics, including dating evolutionary events and divergence times, estimating demographic parameters such as population size and generation time, and investigating the effect of natural selection on molecular evolution.},

	Abstract = {Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a birnavirus causing immunosuppressive disease in chickens. Emergence of the very virulent form of IBDV (vvIBDV) in the late 1980s dramatically changed the epidemiology of the disease. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic origins of its genome segments and estimated the time of emergence of their most recent common ancestors. Moreover, with recently developed coalescence techniques, we reconstructed the past population dynamics of vvIBDV and timed the onset of its expansion to the late 1980s. Our analysis suggests that genome segment A of vvIBDV emerged at least 20 years before its expansion, which argues against the hypothesis that mutation of genome segment A is the major contributing factor in the emergence and expansion of vvIBDV. Alternatively, the phylogeny of genome segment B suggests a possible reassortment event estimated to have taken place around the mid-1980s, which seems to coincide with its expansion within approximately 5 years. We therefore hypothesize that the reassortment of genome segment B initiated vvIBDV expansion in the late 1980s, possibly by enhancing the virulence of the virus synergistically with its existing genome segment A. This report reveals the possible mechanisms leading to the emergence and expansion of vvIBDV, which would certainly provide insights into the scope of surveillance and prevention efforts regarding the disease.},

These bones, dating back to more than 7000 years before the present, harbor some of the best-preserved ancient DNA yet discovered. From 96 radiocarbon-aged bones, we report large numbers of mitochondrial haplotypes, some of which appear to be extinct, given the 380 living birds sampled. We demonstrate DNA sequence evolution through time and estimate the rate of evolution of the hypervariable region I using a Markov chain Monte Carlo integration and a least-squares regression analysis.

	Abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver cancer and cirrhosis, and Egypt has possibly the highest HCV prevalence worldwide. In this article we use a newly developed Bayesian inference framework to estimate the transmission dynamics of HCV in Egypt from sampled viral gene sequences, and to predict the public health impact of the virus. Our results indicate that the effective number of HCV infections in Egypt underwent rapid exponential growth between 1930 and 1955. The timing and speed of this spread provides quantitative genetic evidence that the Egyptian HCV epidemic was initiated and propagated by extensive antischistosomiasis injection campaigns. Although our results show that HCV transmission has since decreased, we conclude that HCV is likely to remain prevalent in Egypt for several decades. Our combined population genetic and epidemiological analysis provides detailed estimates of historical changes in Egyptian HCV prevalence. Because our results are consistent with a demographic scenario specified a priori, they also provide an objective test of inference methods based on the coalescent process.},

@article{Lemey:2004uo,
	Abstract = {HIV-1 group O originated through cross-species transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans and has established a relatively low prevalence in Central Africa. Here, we infer the population genetics and epidemic history of HIV-1 group O from viral gene sequence data and evaluate the effect of variable evolutionary rates and recombination on our estimates. First, model selection tools were used to specify suitable evolutionary and coalescent models for HIV group O. Second, divergence times and population genetic parameters were estimated in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, under both strict and relaxed molecular clock methods. Our results date the origin of the group O radiation to around 1920 (1890-1940), a time frame similar to that estimated for HIV-1 group M. However, group O infections, which remain almost wholly restricted to Cameroon, show a slower rate of exponential growth during the twentieth century, explaining their lower current prevalence. To explore the effect of recombination, the Bayesian framework is extended to incorporate multiple unlinked loci. Although recombination can bias estimates of the time to the most recent common ancestor, this effect does not appear to be important for HIV-1 group O. In addition, we show that evolutionary rate estimates for different HIV genes accurately reflect differential selective constraints along the HIV genome.},

We used ancient DNA and Bayesian techniques to reconstruct a detailed genetic history of bison throughout the late Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Our analyses depict a large diverse population living throughout Beringia until around 37,000 years before the present, when the population's genetic diversity began to decline dramatically. The timing of this decline correlates with environmental changes associated with the onset of the last glacial cycle, whereas archaeological evidence does not support the presence of large populations of humans in Eastern Beringia until more than 15,000 years later.},

@article{Ho:2005rw,
	Abstract = {In recent years, a number of phylogenetic methods have been developed for estimating molecular rates and divergence dates under models that relax the molecular clock constraint by allowing rate change throughout the tree. These methods are being used with increasing frequency, but there have been few studies into their accuracy. We tested the accuracy of several relaxed-clock methods (penalized likelihood and Bayesian inference using various models of rate change) using nucleotide sequences simulated on a nine-taxon tree. When the sequences evolved with a constant rate, the methods were able to infer rates accurately, but estimates were more precise when a molecular clock was assumed. When the sequences evolved under a model of auto-correlated rate change, rates were accurately estimated using penalized likelihood and by Bayesian inference using lognormal and exponential models of rate change, while other models did not perform as well. When the sequences evolved under a model of uncorrelated rate change, only Bayesian inference using an exponential rate model performed well. Collectively, the results provide a strong recommendation for using the exponential model of rate change if a conservative approach to divergence time estimation is required. A case study is presented in which we use a simulation-based approach to examine the hypothesis of elevated rates in the Cambrian period, and it is found that these high rate estimates might be an artifact of the rate estimation method. If this bias is present, then the ages of metazoan divergences would be systematically underestimated. The results of this study have implications for studies of molecular rates and divergence dates.},

@article{Ho:2005rc,
	Abstract = {Studies of molecular evolutionary rates have yielded a wide range of rate estimates for various genes and taxa. Recent studies based on population-level and pedigree data have produced remarkably high estimates of mutation rate, which strongly contrast with substitution rates inferred in phylogenetic (species-level) studies. Using Bayesian analysis with a relaxed-clock model, we estimated rates for three groups of mitochondrial data: avian protein-coding genes, primate protein-coding genes, and primate d-loop sequences. In all three cases, we found a measurable transition between the high, short-term (< 1-2 Myr) mutation rate and the low, long-term substitution rate. The relationship between the age of the calibration and the rate of change can be described by a vertically translated exponential decay curve, which may be used for correcting molecular date estimates. The phylogenetic substitution rates in mitochondria are approximately 0.5% per million years for avian protein-coding sequences and 1.5% per million years for primate protein-coding and d-loop sequences. Further analyses showed that purifying selection offers the most convincing explanation for the observed relationship between the estimated rate and the depth of the calibration. We rule out the possibility that it is a spurious result arising from sequence errors, and find it unlikely that the apparent decline in rates over time is caused by mutational saturation. Using a rate curve estimated from the d-loop data, several dates for last common ancestors were calculated: modern humans and Neandertals (354 ka; 222-705 ka), Neandertals (108 ka; 70-156 ka), and modern humans (76 ka; 47-110 ka). If the rate curve for a particular taxonomic group can be accurately estimated, it can be a useful tool for correcting divergence date estimates by taking the rate decay into account. Our results show that it is invalid to extrapolate molecular rates of change across different evolutionary timescales, which has important consequences for studies of populations, domestication, conservation genetics, and human evolution.},

	Abstract = {Although phylogenetic inference of protein-coding sequences continues to dominate the literature, few analyses incorporate evolutionary models that consider the genetic code. This problem is exacerbated by the exclusion of codon-based models from commonly employed model selection techniques, presumably due to the computational cost associated with codon models. We investigated an efficient alternative to standard nucleotide substitution models, in which codon position (CP) is incorporated into the model. We determined the most appropriate model for alignments of 177 RNA virus genes and 106 yeast genes, using 11 substitution models including one codon model and four CP models. The majority of analyzed gene alignments are best described by CP substitution models, rather than by standard nucleotide models, and without the computational cost of full codon models. These results have significant implications for phylogenetic inference of coding sequences as they make it clear that substitution models incorporating CPs not only are a computationally realistic alternative to standard models but may also frequently be statistically superior.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic diversity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) population within an individual is lost during transmission to a new host. The demography of transmission is an important determinant of evolutionary dynamics, particularly the relative impact of natural selection and genetic drift immediately following HIV-1 infection. Despite this, the magnitude of this population bottleneck is unclear. RESULTS: We use coalescent methods to quantify the bottleneck in a single case of homosexual transmission and find that over 99% of the env and gag diversity present in the donor is lost. This was consistent with the diversity present at seroconversion in nine other horizontally infected individuals. Furthermore, we estimated viral diversity at birth in 27 infants infected through vertical transmission and found there to be no difference between the two modes of transmission. CONCLUSION: Assuming the bottleneck at transmission is selectively neutral, such a severe reduction in genetic diversity has important implications for adaptation in HIV-1, since beneficial mutations have a reduced chance of transmission.},

@article{Edwards:2006eu,
	Abstract = {The evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) during chronic infection involves the rapid, continuous turnover of genetic diversity. However, the role of natural selection, relative to random genetic drift, in governing this process is unclear. We tested a stochastic model of genetic drift using partial envelope sequences sampled longitudinally in 28 infected children. In each case the Bayesian posterior (empirical) distribution of coalescent genealogies was estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Posterior predictive simulation was then used to generate a null distribution of genealogies assuming neutrality, with the null and empirical distributions compared using four genealogy-based summary statistics sensitive to nonneutral evolution. Because both null and empirical distributions were generated within a coalescent framework, we were able to explicitly account for the confounding influence of demography. From the distribution of corrected P-values across patients, we conclude that empirical genealogies are more asymmetric than expected if evolution is driven by mutation and genetic drift only, with an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms in the population. This indicates that although drift may still play an important role, natural selection has a strong influence on the evolution of HIV-1 envelope. A negative relationship between effective population size and substitution rate indicates that as the efficacy of selection increases, a smaller proportion of mutations approach fixation in the population. This suggests the presence of deleterious mutations. We therefore conclude that intrahost HIV-1 evolution in envelope is dominated by purifying selection against low-frequency deleterious mutations that do not reach fixation.},

	Abstract = {Populations of RNA viruses are often characterized by abundant genetic variation. However, the relative fitness of these mutations is largely unknown, although this information is central to our understanding of viral emergence, immune evasion, and drug resistance. Here we develop a phylogenetic method, based on the distribution of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes, to assess the relative fitness of polymorphisms in the structural genes of 143 RNA viruses. This reveals that a substantial proportion of the amino acid variation observed in natural populations of RNA viruses comprises transient deleterious mutations that are later purged by purifying selection, potentially limiting virus adaptability. We also demonstrate, for the first time, the existence of a relationship between amino acid variability and the phylogenetic distribution of polymorphisms. From this relationship, we propose an empirical threshold for the maximum viable deleterious mutation load in RNA viruses.},

	Abstract = {Despite the wealth of data describing the ecological factors that underpin viral emergence, little is known about the evolutionary processes that allow viruses to jump species barriers and establish productive infections in new hosts. Understanding the evolutionary basis to virus emergence is therefore a key research goal and many of the debates in this area can be considered within the rigorous theoretical framework established by evolutionary genetics. In particular, the respective roles played by natural selection and genetic drift in shaping genetic diversity are also of fundamental importance for understanding the nature of viral emergence. Herein, we discuss whether there are evolutionary rules to viral emergence, and especially whether certain types of virus, or those that infect a particular type of host species, are more likely to emerge than others. We stress the complex interplay between rates of viral evolution and the ability to recognize cell receptors from phylogenetically divergent host species. We also emphasize the current lack of convincing data as to whether viral emergence requires adaptation to the new host species during the early stages of infection, or whether it is largely a chance process involving the transmission of a viral strain with the necessary genetic characteristics.},

@article{Rambaut:2008rz,
	Abstract = {DNA sequences extracted from ancient remains are increasingly used to generate large population data sets, often spanning tens of thousands of years of population history. Bayesian coalescent methods such as those implemented in the software package BEAST can be used to estimate the demographic history of these populations, sometimes resulting in complex scenarios of fluctuations in population size, which can be correlated with the timing of environmental events, such as glaciations. Recently, however, Axelsson et al. (2008) claimed that many of these complex demographic trends are likely to be the result of post-mortem DNA damage, a problem that they investigate by removing all sites involving transitions from ancient sequences prior to analysis. When this solution is applied to a previously published data set of Pleistocene bison, they show that the demographic signal of population expansion and decline disappears. While some apparently segregating mutations in ancient sequences may be due to post-mortem damage, we argue that discarding the data will result in loss of power to detect patterns of population change. Instead, to accommodate this problem, we implement a model in which sequences are the result of a joint process of molecular evolution and post-mortem DNA damage within a probabilistic inference framework. Through simulation, we demonstrate the ability of this model to accurately recover evolutionary parameters, demographic history and DNA damage rates. When this model is applied to the bison data set, we find that the rate of DNA damage is significant but low, and that the reconstruction of population size history is nearly identical to previously published estimates.},

	Abstract = {Past population size can be estimated from modern genetic diversity using coalescent theory. Estimates of ancestral human population dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa can tell us about the timing and nature of our first steps towards colonizing the globe. Here, we combine Bayesian coalescent inference with a dataset of 224 complete human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences to estimate effective population size through time for each of the four major African mtDNA haplogroups (L0-L3). We find evidence of three distinct demographic histories underlying the four haplogroups. Haplogroups L0 and L1 both show slow, steady exponential growth from 156 to 213kyr ago. By contrast, haplogroups L2 and L3 show evidence of substantial growth beginning 12-20 and 61-86kyr ago, respectively. These later expansions may be associated with contemporaneous environmental and/or cultural changes. The timing of the L3 expansion-8-12kyr prior to the emergence of the first non-African mtDNA lineages-together with high L3 diversity in eastern Africa, strongly supports the proposal that the human exodus from Africa and subsequent colonization of the globe was prefaced by a major expansion within Africa, perhaps driven by some form of cultural innovation.},

	Abstract = {The relative timing and size of regional human population growth following our expansion from Africa remain unknown. Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity carries a legacy of our population history. Given a set of sequences, we can use coalescent theory to estimate past population size through time and draw inferences about human population history. However, recent work has challenged the validity of using mtDNA diversity to infer species population sizes. Here we use Bayesian coalescent inference methods, together with a global data set of 357 human mtDNA coding-region sequences, to infer human population sizes through time across 8 major geographic regions. Our estimates of relative population sizes show remarkable concordance with the contemporary regional distribution of humans across Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas, indicating that mtDNA diversity is a good predictor of population size in humans. Plots of population size through time show slow growth in sub-Saharan Africa beginning 143-193 kya, followed by a rapid expansion into Eurasia after the emergence of the first non-African mtDNA lineages 50-70 kya. Outside Africa, the earliest and fastest growth is inferred in Southern Asia approximately 52 kya, followed by a succession of growth phases in Northern and Central Asia (approximately 49 kya), Australia (approximately 48 kya), Europe (approximately 42 kya), the Middle East and North Africa (approximately 40 kya), New Guinea (approximately 39 kya), the Americas (approximately 18 kya), and a second expansion in Europe (approximately 10-15 kya). Comparisons of relative regional population sizes through time suggest that between approximately 45 and 20 kya most of humanity lived in Southern Asia. These findings not only support the use of mtDNA data for estimating human population size but also provide a unique picture of human prehistory and demonstrate the importance of Southern Asia to our recent evolutionary past.},

@article{Hon:2008xy,
	Abstract = {Bats have been identified as the natural reservoir of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like and SARS coronaviruses (SLCoV and SCoV). However, previous studies suggested that none of the currently sampled bat SLCoVs is the descendant of the direct ancestor of SCoV, based on their relatively distant phylogenetic relationship. In this study, evidence of the recombinant origin of the genome of a bat SLCoV is demonstrated. We identified a potential recombination breakpoint immediately after the consensus intergenic sequence between open reading frame 1 and the S coding region, suggesting the replication intermediates may participate in the recombination event, as previously speculated for other CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis of its parental regions suggests the presence of an uncharacterized SLCoV lineage that is phylogenetically closer to SCoVs than any of the currently sampled bat SLCoVs. Using various Bayesian molecular-clock models, interspecies transfer of this SLCoV lineage from bats to the amplifying host (e.g., civets) was estimated to have happened a median of 4.08 years before the SARS outbreak. Based on this relatively short window period, we speculate that this uncharacterized SLCoV lineage may contain the direct ancestor of SCoV. This study sheds light on the possible host bat species of the direct ancestor of SCoV, providing valuable information on the scope and focus of surveillance for the origin of SCoV.},

	Abstract = {Using sequence data to infer population dynamics is playing an increasing role in the analysis of outbreaks. The most common methods in use, based on coalescent inference, have been widely used but not extensively tested against simulated epidemics. Here, we use simulated data to test the ability of both parametric and non-parametric methods for inference of effective population size (coded in the popular BEAST package) to reconstruct epidemic dynamics. We consider a range of simulations centred on scenarios considered plausible for pandemic influenza, but our conclusions are generic for any exponentially growing epidemic. We highlight systematic biases in non-parametric effective population size estimation. The most prominent such bias leads to the false inference of slowing of epidemic spread in the recent past even when the real epidemic is growing exponentially. We suggest some sampling strategies that could reduce (but not eliminate) some of the biases. Parametric methods can correct for these biases if the infected population size is large. We also explore how some poor sampling strategies (e.g. that over-represent epidemiologically linked clusters of cases) could dramatically exacerbate bias in an uncontrolled manner. Finally, we present a simple diagnostic indicator, based on coalescent density and which can easily be applied to reconstructed phylogenies, that identifies time-periods for which effective population size estimates are less likely to be biased. We illustrate this with an application to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. },

Here, we present a high-resolution data set from multiple independent loci across the nuclear genomes of a broad sample of polar, brown, and black bears. Bayesian coalescent analyses place polar bears outside the brown bear clade and date the divergence much earlier, in the middle Pleistocene, about 600 (338 to 934) thousand years ago. This provides more time for polar bear evolution and confirms previous suggestions that polar bears carry introgressed brown bear mitochondrial DNA due to past hybridization. Our results highlight that multilocus genomic analyses are crucial for an accurate understanding of evolutionary history.},

@article{Molina17052011,
	Abstract = {Asian rice, Oryza sativa, is one of world's oldest and most important crop species. Rice is believed to have been domesticated ∼9,000 y ago, although debate on its origin remains contentious. A single-origin model suggests that two main subspecies of Asian rice, indica and japonica, were domesticated from the wild rice O. rufipogon. In contrast, the multiple independent domestication model proposes that these two major rice types were domesticated separately and in different parts of the species range of wild rice. This latter view has gained much support from the observation of strong genetic differentiation between indica and japonica as well as several phylogenetic studies of rice domestication. We reexamine the evolutionary history of domesticated rice by resequencing 630 gene fragments on chromosomes 8, 10, and 12 from a diverse set of wild and domesticated rice accessions. Using patterns of SNPs, we identify 20 putative selective sweeps on these chromosomes in cultivated rice. Demographic modeling based on these SNP data and a diffusion-based approach provide the strongest support for a single domestication origin of rice. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses implementing the multispecies coalescent and using previously published phylogenetic sequence datasets also point to a single origin of Asian domesticated rice. Finally, we date the origin of domestication at ∼8,200--13,500 y ago, depending on the molecular clock estimate that is used, which is consistent with known archaeological data that suggests rice was first cultivated at around this time in the Yangtze Valley of China.},

@article{Campos23032010,
	Abstract = {The causes of the late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions are poorly understood. Different lines of evidence point to climate change, the arrival of humans, or a combination of these events as the trigger. Although many species went extinct, others, such as caribou and bison, survived to the present. The musk ox has an intermediate story: relatively abundant during the Pleistocene, it is now restricted to Greenland and the Arctic Archipelago. In this study, we use ancient DNA sequences, temporally unbiased summary statistics, and Bayesian analytical techniques to infer musk ox population dynamics throughout the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Our results reveal that musk ox genetic diversity was much higher during the Pleistocene than at present, and has undergone several expansions and contractions over the past 60,000 years. Northeast Siberia was of key importance, as it was the geographic origin of all samples studied and held a large diverse population until local extinction at ≈45,000 radiocarbon years before present (14C YBP). Subsequently, musk ox genetic diversity reincreased at ca. 30,000 14C YBP, recontracted at ca. 18,000 14C YBP, and finally recovered in the middle Holocene. The arrival of humans into relevant areas of the musk ox range did not affect their mitochondrial diversity, and both musk ox and humans expanded into Greenland concomitantly. Thus, their population dynamics are better explained by a nonanthropogenic cause (for example, environmental change), a hypothesis supported by historic observations on the sensitivity of the species to both climatic warming and fluctuations.},
